"Joe Rogan Says Most Americans Don't Want Manufacturing Jobs But The 'Problem' Is That For Some Doing Them Now, 'It's Their Entire Identity'",BLK ,"On a recent episode of the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, host Joe Rogan and Replit CEO Amjad Masad explored the rise of AI, the collapse of routine jobs, and what happens when someone’s entire sense of self is tied to work that may soon vanish.
Rogan voiced concern about what happens when automation hits not just jobs, but people's sense of purpose.
""My problem is there's some people that are doing those jobs right now and it's their entire identity,"" Rogan said. ""They work for a good company, they make a good living, and that might go away, and they're just not psychologically equipped to completely change their life.""
Don't Miss:
Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $10.

He added that many of these people are ""valuable parts of a certain business"" and ""hardworking,"" saying, ""They show up every day. Everybody loves them and trusts them. And that's part of who they are as a person.""
Masad, founder and CEO of a cloud-based coding platform agreed, but argued that it’s actually white-collar desk jobs that are more at risk in the short term, not manufacturing roles.
""I actually think that more white-collar jobs are going away,"" Masad said, and explained that ten years ago, we thought it would be truck drivers or robots in factories that would happen first. But it turns out, it's much easier to automate formulaic computer tasks.
He pointed to roles like software quality assurance and Excel-heavy jobs that are highly repetitive and easy for AI to mimic. “We have a lot more data on people sitting in front of a computer,” he said.
Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates.
While President Donald Trump often calls for a manufacturing comeback to restore America’s status as a “manufacturing superpower,” most Americans don't want those jobs for themselves. A 2024 Cato Institute survey found that 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off with more factory jobs, but only 25% said they personally would want one. About 73% said no, and only 2% currently work in the sector.
According to the Manufacturing Institute Executive Director Carolyn Lee, many modern manufacturing jobs are no longer entry-level. ""The majority of the jobs in the sector are not entry-level jobs that have no skills,"" she told CNN in April, noting that they now often require certifications and experience with software and robotics.

Rogan pushed back against the optimism around reskilling, raising a deeper concern: not everyone will bounce back.
""Desperation, unfortunately, is going to motivate people to make changes,"" he said. ""It's going to also motivate some people to choose drugs. That's my fear.""
Masad acknowledged the challenge of retraining workers later in life. While reskilling has seen success in the past, he called the “learn to code” push aimed at displaced workers like miners “really cruel.”
Still, he believes there is an opportunity, especially for those already working on computers to reskill and start using AI to automate a big part of their job.
Rogan admitted that most Americans likely don't want manufacturing jobs, but cautioned that losing them isn’t just an economic issue. It’s about the people doing them now.

UK reversal of Companies House reforms may affect SMEs,VST ,"The UK government is considering a reversal of the planned Companies House reforms that would have required small businesses (SMEs) to file accounts using compliant software by 1 April 2027.
This sudden policy shift is likely to impact SMEs’ accounting practices.
This shift has been acknowledged by Meg Ogunsola, global director of Entity Management Solutions at Vistra, as a significant reminder of the difficulties in implementing new regulations that are both practical and protective for businesses.
Ogunsola emphasises the importance of smaller firms working with knowledgeable partners to manage the uncertainty of evolving regulations and maintain compliance without undue hardship.
Despite the potential reversal, she supports the measures under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act (ECCTA).
She also cautions businesses to prepare for the mandatory ID verification for directors, PSCs, and LLP members, which is expected to be enforced this autumn.
Meg Ogunsola said: ""The Government’s potential U-turn on Companies House reforms for filing rules highlights the complexity of drafting and introducing regulations, and the tricky balancing act of protecting and overburdening firms. These complexities demonstrate the need for companies, particularly smaller ones, to partner with suppliers that can help them navigate regulatory uncertainty, reduce operational strain, and support compliance.”
She added: ""Despite this change, the ECCTA remains critical in the UK's fight against fraud, and with mandatory ID verification coming into force this autumn, businesses must act now to ensure they are prepared.""
""UK reversal of Companies House reforms may affect SMEs"" was originally created and published by International Accounting Bulletin, a GlobalData owned brand.

The company’s operations include antimony smelting in Montana and Mexico, and a zeolite mine in Idaho. It serves sectors such as flame retardants, batteries, and water filtration, among others.
On March 17, 2025, Chinese Customs refused to clear the company’s shipment of 50 tons of stibnite ore. The issue could not be resolved, and the shipment was returned to Australia, thus creating significant supply chain challenges for United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE:UAMY). Amid this challenge, on June 27, 2025, the company announced the successful acquisition of 100% of the ownership interest of Fostung Properties. With this acquisition, the company has control over 50 single-cell mining claims or 1,114 hectares located approximately 70 kilometers west-southwest of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, near the town of Espanola.
Following these developments, Alliance Global Partners reiterated their Buy rating on the stock while setting the price target of $5.25.
With a consensus 1-year median price target of $5.00 and a closing price $2.18 as of June 30, 2025, United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE:UAMY) could potentially be one of the best high risk penny stocks to invest in right now.

Bankrupt Wolfspeed taps new CFO,WOLF ,"This story was originally published on CFO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter. 
Semiconductor manufacturer Wolfspeed announced industry alum Gregor van Issum will take the role of CFO effective Sept. 1, following “a comprehensive review of internal and external candidates,” according to a Monday press release. He will succeed interim CFO Kevin Speirits, who will remain with the company to ensure a smooth transition.
The CFO appointment comes shortly after the Durham, North Carolina-based company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 30 as part of a restructuring plan aimed at reducing its debt and strengthening its capital structure, according to a press release at the time. The company is aiming to offload 70% of its debt or approximately $4.6 billion with the restructuring.
“In this new role, my priority will be providing Wolfspeed’s investors with transparency and clarity, especially during this transformative period,” Van Issum said in a statement included in the release.“Building on recent steps to restructure Wolfspeed’s balance sheet, I will draw on my experience navigating complex business cycles to help create a capital structure that offers agility to respond to rapid shifts in the market.”
A 20-year alum of the technology industry, Van Issum most recently served as EVP and group controller for fellow semiconductor manufacturer ams-OSRAM, according to the Monday press release.
Prior to ams-OSRAM, he spent 11 years in various strategic finance and executive roles at NXP Semiconductors, including a VP, head of strategy BL secure transactions and identification — a role responsible for the strategic marketing of global security transactions and identification business, according to his LinkedIn profile.
As CFO, Van Issum will receive an annual base salary of $500,000, according to a securities filing. He will also be eligible for an annual performance bonus with a target value of 75% of his base salary and will receive a cash sign-on bonus of $450,000, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, Van Issum will receive an award of restricted stock units with a value of $3 million, with one-fourth of the RSUs to vest on each of the four anniversaries following his Sept. 1 effective date, per the filing.
Van Issum’s appointment is the latest executive leadership move by the semiconductor manufacturer as it looks to revitilize its balance sheet, coming after the firm tapped a company veteran for the newly-created role of chief operating officer and appointed Robert Feurle to its top executive seat and as chairman of the board this May.
The reconstituted leadership team will aim to shepherd the company through its planned restructuring. Wolfspeed and its subsidiary Wolfspeed Texas LLC each filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on June 30 after announcing a restructuring agreement with key debtholders on June 22, according to an SEC filing.
The bankruptcy is part of a bid by the chipmaker, which creates silicon carbide wafters and other chip components, to offload a significant portion of its debt and follows months-long talks with its lenders, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.
While Wolfspeed’s operations are mainly in the U.S. — putting it in an advantageous position given the tariffs proposed by the Trump administration — the semiconductor manufacturer’s debt has put a strain on its operations, the WSJ reported. As of its Chapter 11 filing, the company had approximately $6.7 billion in total funded debt, according to its disclosure statement. 
The chipmaker has made previous efforts to cut down on costs and strengthen its balance sheet, laying off 20% of its global workforce and closing down several facilities as part of a strategy to save approximately $200 million last year, CFO Dive sister publication Manufacturing Dive previously reported.
In March, Wolfspeed announced plans to cut another 180 jobs, as part of an effort to boost its financial performance and “accelerate its path to generate positive free cash flow,” according to an SEC filing. The move came as a previously announced $750 million grant by the Biden administration under the CHIPS Act fell under a spotlight — later that same month, Wolfspeed’s stock fell to a 27-year low amid concerns that it would not receive the funding under the Trump administration. In May, then-Chairman Thomas Werner said the company was in the midst of a “constructive dialogue” with the Trump administration, Manufacturing Dive reported.
Wolfspeed did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
