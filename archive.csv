Is Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,SPOT ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.
To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

"Is Amer Sports, Inc. (AS) Among the Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?",AS ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amer Sports, Inc. (NYSE:AS) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.
Golf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.
The golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.
According to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.
Finally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum.
Marc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:
“The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.”
The exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.
Technology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf’s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show’s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success.

Then, we selected the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential as of April 9, 2025. We have only included stocks in our list with an upside potential of 10% or higher. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).
Analysts’ Upside Potential as of April 9: 35.37%
Amer Sports, Inc. (NYSE:AS) oversees a wide portfolio of ten outdoor and action sports brands, with a combined turnover of $4.4 billion in 2023. Despite being primarily controlled by the Chinese business Anta Sports, the firm functions independently. Its rapidly expanding China business is subject to more intense scrutiny, although its activities outside of China are managed with considerable independence.
The company’s Ball & Racquet Sports division provides golf and other professional and recreational sports equipment, as well as functional athletic gear. Its brand Wilson, in particular, is a significant golf equipment manufacturer, providing high-quality clubs, balls, and accessories. Although the firm manufactures golf equipment, it is most known for its tennis goods, among others. Amer Sports, Inc. (NYSE:AS) stock has generated a return of more than 56% over the past year, making it among the Best Golf Stocks.
Amer Sports, Inc. (NYSE:AS) reached record sales in 2024, with a rise of 23% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and an 18% growth for the year, totaling $5.2 billion. The company’s adjusted operating margin went up significantly, rising by more than 300 basis points in Q4 and 130 basis points for the year, reaching 11.1%. Key brands did well, with Arc’teryx exceeding $2 billion in sales and achieving 29% omni-channel growth in Q4, Salomon footwear exceeding $1 billion in sales, and Wilson regaining the top U.S. market share for Performance Racquets. The business also experienced strong growth in Greater China and APAC, with rises of 54% and 52%, respectively, strengthened by the establishment of new outlets. It earned $425 million in operating cash flow and lowered its net debt to $600 million by the end of the year, thereby improving its leverage.
Overall, AS ranks 5th on our list of the 10 best golf stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of golf companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

“Screw the Chinese or Get Screwed!” – Jim Cramer’s Bold Amazon.com (AMZN) Take,AMZN ,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.
“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”

Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said
“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”
Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.
“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’
For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 339
Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was mentioned during the episode, and here’s what Mad Money’s host had to say:
“Finally, and most obviously, there are three retailers with the balance sheets to win and to own. It’s Amazon, Walmart, and Costco. Take a look around at all the other retailers. They could be in their death rows, death by withdrawal. With the exception of the two big box hardware stores, I don’t know how they can make it if they’re up against those big three.”
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides a wide range of services, including online retail, subscription programs, and advertising solutions. On Monday, Cramer commented:
“But I do believe right now there’s negotiations, let’s say with Amazon. Amazon has a lot of stuff that is made, that’s branded, and I don’t think that stuff’s coming here. I think that stuff’s frozen until they come up with negotiations. […] You’re Amazon, you want to screw the Chinese, the Chinese want to screw you. The only thing you can do is have some sort of meeting of the minds and someone has to pay. […] I’m looking to see whether Amazon’s going to go out of stock on some key things because they were made in China and they cancelled the purchase order. I think that they will.”
Overall, AMZN ranks 10th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Apple Stock's 27% Crash: Here's Where I Predict It Will Trade Next,AAPL ,"The United States government is trying to upend global supply chains with China, slapping a tariff rate approaching 150% as of this writing on imports from China into the U.S. Multinational corporations are getting caught in the middle. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be the company with the worst exposure.
Not only is the smartphone and computer brand a huge user of Chinese manufacturing and electronics assembly, it also sells billions of dollars' worth of products into the Chinese market every year. The sale of these products may be at risk due to retaliation from the Chinese government.
Unsurprisingly, Apple stock has crashed 27% from all-time highs on this news. But the pain may be far from over. Here's how tariffs could affect Apple's business, and where the stock could move through the rest of 2025.
Apple has worked to diversify its global supply chain, but still greatly utilizes China to build its iPhones. In order to bring these products into the United States using existing manufacturing lines, Apple will need to pay a 150% surcharge on these imports, unless the levy is waived. That could have some ugly ramifications for Apple's unit costs.
The Wall Street Journal made some estimates of how tariffs could affect the cost of an iPhone for Apple. It was estimated that an iPhone previously cost $550 to build. With a 54% tariff -- the original proposed increase on Chinese imports -- an iPhone will now cost Apple $850 to bring to America. Add on the newly minted tariffs, and you are getting a bill of well over $1,000 per phone.
This presents a problem for Apple. Ever since iPhone production scaled up, Apple has sported a consolidated operating margin of 25%, best in class for an electronics manufacturer. That is because it could make an iPhone for half of what it sold it to customers for. Today, you can buy a new iPhone for $1,000, with some models costing more and some a little less. If Apple wants to maintain its same unit economics under the tariffs, it will have to raise the price of a new iPhone to $1,500 based on these new Chinese tariffs.
Can its existing customer base afford this upgrade? I doubt it. My hunch is that a $500 increase in selling prices will lead to cratering demand for new iPhones. Many customers will delay upgrades, especially since new iPhones currently come with minimal upgrades from previous versions. This is an ugly situation for Apple, which could see collapsing demand with tightening margins that could drastically affect its earnings power.
Wait, can't Apple just make its iPhone somewhere else? Sure, it can. But at what cost? First, it will take many years to move supply chains and replicate them in other Asian countries, or perhaps even in Latin America. Apple has aimed to move some of its production to India and Vietnam over the last few years, but that still remains a small sliver of its production sourcing. This will not be cheap, either.
Moving production back to the United States is technically an option, but this would take much longer and lead to higher selling prices due to the high manufacturing wages paid to laborers in the U.S. Plus, Apple would still have to pay tariffs on imports of raw materials. This isn't an option, unless you think people will willingly pay for $5,000 iPhones.
Even before these changes, Apple's revenue was stagnating. It has barely grown since the end of 2021, with profit margin expansion the only growth engine at the moment. This margin expansion is about to reverse course. Apple's $126 billion in operating income will start falling over the next 12 months if these tariffs on China are not rolled back.
As you can see, there is a ton of risk to Apple's business right now. You might think this means Apple's stock is trading at a dirt chip earnings multiple to counteract this risk. Logical, but incorrect.
Miraculously -- or perhaps frighteningly -- Apple stock still trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 30. This is well above the S&P 500 average and the long-term market average of 15 to 20. Remember, Apple's earnings are lining up to fall this year, which will lead its P/E ratio to climb even higher. Its forward P/E ratio may be above 50 in a worst-case scenario.
In my view, this makes Apple stock radically overvalued. I predict more pain for Apple shareholders in 2025 unless these tariffs are completely walked back.

Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?,NVDA ,"This has been a brutal year for the U.S. tech industry as a combination of challenges, ranging from political uncertainty to foreign competition, has shaken some of its core assumptions. Globalism is no longer guaranteed, and developing markets like China are transitioning from a source of low-cost labor into a viable threat to U.S. technological dominance. 
The next 12 months could be a make-or-break period for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as it navigates the evolving macroeconomic landscape. Let's dig deeper to decide how the company's shares might perform.
While it is too early to be sure, President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff announcement may mark the beginning of the end for globalization -- a system that facilitated increasingly complex international supply chains. Nvidia is a typical example of how globalized business models work. 
As a fabless semiconductor company, Nvidia only designs its chips. Their actual production is outsourced to foreign companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which produces them with the help of EUV machines from the Dutch company ASML. 
These international interdependencies could draw unwelcome political attention. But the good news is that Nvidia worked to preempt this exposure with the help of its manufacturing partners. 
In late 2024, TSMC opened its first U.S. factory in Arizona, allowing Nvidia to source its cutting-edge Blackwell AI chips domestically. This move could shield the company from potential tariffs, which is essential for its long-term success. Even though semiconductors are currently exempt from this latest round of tariffs, their strategic nature will likely attract attention from this administration and future U.S. lawmakers, so it is advantageous for Nvidia to get ahead of this potential headwind. 
Although trade war talk is stealing the show in April, Nvidia's stock price crash started in January, with the launch of the high-performing Chinese large language model (LLM) DeepSeek V3, which was allegedly developed for just $6 million. While the actual cost is still hotly debated, it is believed that V3 was built using much less advanced H800 chips while still comparing favorably to American LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which were built with substantially more expensive hardware.
DeepSeek calls into question the amount of money American AI companies are spending on Nvidia hardware. And while major customers like Meta Platforms continue to plow money into the opportunity, it may be a matter of time before they face shareholder backlash over the amount being spent for minimal financial reward. 
In April, an Indian start-up called Ziroh Labs added even more uncertainty to the U.S. AI market with the release of Kompact AI, a system designed to run LLMs without advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) made by companies like Nvidia. Inference (the process where an AI model uses its trained knowledge to generate output) represents a significant source of demand for Nvidia's hardware. Kompact AI aims to facilitate this process using less expensive central processing units (CPUs), which are widely available on consumer devices like laptops and computers.
Over the next 12 months, Nvidia should face substantial volatility. Even though the company seems relatively isolated from the direct impacts of the trade war, that isn't stopping investors from jumping ship. Low-cost competition from China and India is also beginning to call into question the importance of its most advanced (and expensive) GPUs for training and running competitive LLMs. 
With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25, Nvidia's current valuation is relatively low for a company that grew fourth-quarter profits by 80% year over year. This discount already prices in much of the uncertainty. However, investors may want to wait for the stock to fall deeper into oversold territory before considering a position. 
The events of early April have made this a fear and uncertainty-driven market. And until that changes, fundamentals may take the back seat.

TSMC first-quarter profit likely soared but Trump policies cloud outlook,TSM ,"By Ben Blanchard and Wen-Yee Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - TSMC, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 54% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though is also likely to flag risk from trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a trend towards implementing AI features in online products. But the firm faces headwind not just from Trump's import tariffs but also his criticism of Taiwan's dominance of the chip industry.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is set to report net profit of T$347.8 billion ($10.74 billion) for the three months through March 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 17 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.
That estimate compares to the 2024 first-quarter net profit of T$225.5 billion.
TSMC has been spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, though it said most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. It announced a $100 billion investment with Trump at the White House last month, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona.
Trump has both praised Taiwan's chip industry and threatened it with tariffs.
Last week, he said he had told TSMC it would have to pay a tax of up to 100% if it did not build factories in the U.S. On Sunday, he said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from tariffs on China will be short-lived, pledging a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.
""The company will likely double down on overseas fab investments to mitigate the geopolitical risk, despite two to three percentage points of gross margin dilution for the next five years,"" said SemiAnalysis analyst Sravan Kundojjala.
""This will likely ensure TSMC gets favourable treatment from the U.S. government and minimise the tariff burden.""
Apple's iPhones, given they are mainly made in China, is another risk area for TSMC, said Cathay Futures analyst Venson Tsai.
""If the iPhone can't be sold, then TSMC's chips can't either,"" Tsai said.
TSMC last week reported a surge in first-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, slightly ahead of market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday.
It will also update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure for production increases.
On its last earnings call in January, TSMC said it expected capital spending this year to be $38 billion to $42 billion, an increase of as much as 41% from last year.

What Analysts Think of Netflix Stock Ahead of Earnings,NFLX ,"Rolf Vennenbernd / picture alliance / Getty Images

Netflix is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.
Analysts expect the streaming giant to report rising revenue and profit.
The majority of firms tracked by Visible Alpha have a ""buy"" or equivalent rating on Netflix stock.

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts suggesting the streaming giant could be well-positioned to weather an uncertain macroeconomic environment.
In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan called Netflix the “most resilient” company it tracks, given the streamer's strong subscriber base, with members watching an average of two hours of content per day. The bank holds an “overweight” rating and $1,025 price target for the stock.
Morgan Stanley also named Netflix a ""top pick,"" expecting the company could “demonstrate relative resilience in a weaker global macro.” The analysts called the pullback in Netflix shares in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on April 2 a “buying opportunity” for investors.
All told, 14 of the 18 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha have ""buy"" or equivalent ratings for the stock, with the remainder issuing a ""hold"" rating. Their consensus price target of about $1,097 would suggest nearly 20% upside from Friday’s close.
Netflix is expected to report revenue of $10.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and net income of $2.48 billion, or $5.69 per share, rising from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier.
Netflix shares have risen nearly 50% over the past 12 months, at $918.29 as of Friday's close.

Is Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,CMCSA ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.
To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Value of total Investment by Billionaires: $3.09 billion
Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a global media and technology conglomerate operating through five key segments. The company houses brands such as NBC and Telemundo. It also manages international networks like Sky Sports and Sky’s film and television production and distribution, theme parks across the US, Japan, and China, and online streaming platforms, along with interests in the Philadelphia Flyers and Wells Fargo Center. CMCSA’s earnings for the final quarter of 2024 revealed a revenue of $31.92 billion, clearing expectations by $291.5 million. EPS was $0.96, beating estimates by $0.10.
According to a report by Nielsen, TV viewership continued to decline in February 2025, while streaming services continued to grow. Broadcast viewership and cable viewership declined by 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively. This is a rising trend in the television industry and is considered a threat to CMCSA’s business model. President Mi spoke during the earnings call report, emphasizing his belief in the company’s strategy, specifically streaming & data services, and Park’s performance. This is what he said:
“Our TV studios ended the broadcast season with more top 10 series than any other studio. And finally, in our Destinations & Experiences business, we finished the year strong across our parks globally after having experienced some temporary headwinds in the middle of the year. Our team stayed hard at work preparing for the opening of Epic Universe in May of this year.”
Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has a robust fan following, especially due to its streaming of the NFL, the Olympics, the Premier League, NASCAR, golf, and later this year, the NBA, making it one of the best kid-friendly stocks worldwide.
Overall, CMCSA ranks 7th on our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Worried About the Stock Market? History Says Investors Should Keep These 3 Things in Mind.,^GSPC ,"The stock market may be the best place to build long-term wealth, but there's no guarantee it will be a smooth ride as investors have likely noticed in the past week of steep price swings.
The announcement of fresh tariff policies on April 2 sent the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) plunging. The downward trend continued into the following week until April 9, when President Trump issued a 90-day pause on nearly all of the newly announced tariffs, except those on Chinese goods. That reversal pushed the benchmark index up a jaw-dropping 9.5% in a single session.
Despite that temporary sigh of relief, many investors are still worried. In times of uncertainty, history says to keep these three things in mind to stay on track with your portfolio.
Everyone wants to see the value of their portfolio always go up and to the right, but this just isn't how the market works. If you view the stock market as a reflection of every investor's mood at any given point in time, it makes sense there will be periods of extreme optimism, as well as times when it feels like the world is ending. 
In other words, corrections and bear markets aren't anything new. In fact, the S&P 500 has experienced a correction 56 times since 1950, and a bear market occurs about once every three-and-a-half years. Despite the down periods, which can be unnerving, the broad index has produced a historical average annualized return of 10%. 
It's also worth mentioning that the best buying opportunities can often present themselves when the prevailing market sentiment is most bearish. As legendary investor Warren Buffett is known for saying, ""Be greedy when others are fearful."" 
The current economic environment is full of uncertainty. Investment banks are updating their models to reflect increased odds that the U.S. will enter a recession this year. Consumer confidence has plummeted, and it's now at the lowest level in over two years. Companies are lowering their growth forecasts.
To be clear, it's natural for an investor to worry when facing these developments. The situation might even discourage you from putting money in the market, or even worse, it might lead you to sell your stocks. 
But if you look at the past, it also becomes clear how investors must always grapple with an uncertain environment. Just in the past five years, they've had to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain bottlenecks, inflationary pressures, and rapidly rising interest rates. Yet, those issues didn't prevent the S&P 500 from posting a total return of 96% since April 2020.
So, while the market hates uncertainty, the truth is the future is always somewhat unpredictable. Good companies can adapt to changing industry conditions.
When there's a lot of volatility in the stock market, the best course of action is to strategically sell high and buy low, right? After all, it makes sense that investors would want to avoid the sell-off and profit from the recovery.
This is easier said than done, though, and it is likely to end up causing more harm to your portfolio than simply holding fast. What matters most is spending time in the market, not perfectly timing your investments. This means being fully invested, assuming you have taken important measures like establishing an adequate emergency fund and paying off high-interest debt.
A powerful tool of consistency is called dollar-cost averaging. Adding to your portfolio at set intervals, say monthly or quarterly, helps to build a habit of regular investing regardless of what the market or economy seem to be doing. It also keeps your attention on the long term, not the latest headlines that are mostly just a distraction at the end of the day.
Investors worried about the market's latest turmoil should remember these three things to maintain the right mindset moving forward.
Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Why MV Oil Trust (MVO) Stock is Gaining This Week,MVO ,"We recently compiled a list of the Energy Stocks that are Gaining This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MV Oil Trust (NYSE:MVO) stands against the other energy stocks.
The energy industry has found itself right in the crosshairs of President Trump’s tariff war, sliding more than 8% over the last five days, against a decline of just around 0.5% by the wider market. The global price of crude oil has plummeted by around 22% since the beginning of the year, with the WTI price currently hovering around the $60 mark. The primary reasons for this decline are the escalating US-China trade war, the high prospects of a global economic slowdown, and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May. The Trump administration has indicated a strong preference for reducing crude prices to $50 or lower, but whether this is actually possible remains to be seen, considering that the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
One sector that has garnered special attention from the White House is that of coal. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that aim to boost coal production, while another order asked the US Attorney General to identify state climate laws that stand in the way of developing energy resources like coal and try to stop them from being enforced. Following the President’s orders, the US Energy Department made $200 billion in financing available for its loan programs office including for new coal technologies. However, the orders have raised serious environmental concerns since coal is among the dirtiest fuels available to generate energy. It also remains to be seen whether there is any actual demand for increased coal output, since hundreds of coal-burning plants have already been shut down over the last decade.

To collect data for this article, we have referred to several stock screeners to find energy stocks that have surged the most between April 3 and April 10, 2025. Following are the Energy Stocks that Gained the Most This Week. The stocks are ranked according to their share price surge during this period.

Share Price Gains Between Apr. 3 – Apr. 10: 6.1%

Despite the recent uptick, the share price of MVO has fallen by more than 44% over the last 52 weeks.

"Is H&R Block, Inc. (HRB) the Safest Dividend Stock to Buy Now?",HRB ,"We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB) stands against other safest dividend stocks to buy now.
Today, in this article, we will be looking at the 10 safest dividend stocks you might be interested in adding to your portfolio.
The stock market has become increasingly volatile, constantly causing investors to look for stability. But few instruments offer stability as much as dividend-paying stocks.

With fresh trade tensions arising from unprecedented policy revisions from Washington, price appreciation alone may not be a dependable strategy for investors. Income-focused portfolios are becoming more than just a hedge. They are a necessity.
President Trump made a recent announcement, an update to the new tariff policies, whereby a whopping 145% rate is slapped on Chinese imports while maintaining a 10% baseline for other countries for 90 days. Negotiations are expected between the U.S. and other countries during this period, which, if they do not go well, will bring back the reciprocal tariffs originally announced on April 2, 2025. The announcement sent ripples once again across the global trade. All the major indices are struggling to find equilibrium in the middle of the uncertainty. The situation further raises the importance of stabilized equities that could remain immune to the market whiplash up to some level.
In this regard, safe dividend stocks provide income without compromising their defensiveness – qualities that are becoming harder to ignore in today’s time. Investments in dividend stocks are not just about cushioning against losses but also about long-term compounding and shareholder rewards. Investors prioritize dividends for the sake of sustainable yield that builds wealth gradually. Companies with strong dividend track records have historically stood against worse market conditions more effectively than their non-dividend counterparts. These stocks have safely harbored elevated capital inflow at times of increased volatility, indicating their trust in the broader market.
Recent market turmoil sees value-based investments in dividend-yielding equities becoming a compelling alternative to growth stocks investing among institutional players. Multiple strategists covered by CNBC noted portfolio managers pulling their investments from speculative names and diverting into more fundamentally grounded positions to overcome the unpredictable policy actions and inflation volatility.
But which dividend stocks to pick? Investors are facing not only economic cycles in today’s market environment but also political cycles. Trade, taxation, and regulation are politicized so that the markets are exposed to a profoundly impactful risk that cannot be quantified. It calls for a revisal of a portfolio that includes equities rooted in strong fundamentals and offers high yields.
With this in mind, our article will explore the 10 safest stocks investors could buy now to add resilience to their portfolios. Our curated selection is designed to offer consistent payouts and protect capital from the tremors induced by policies today. You might want to safeguard your capital, generate passive income, or just sleep better at night. Our picks in this article offer you all these in a market that is anything but predictable.
When assembling our list, we followed a few criteria to optimize our picks for the investors. Primarily, we included those stocks with a minimum market cap of $2 billion to ensure the financial soundness of the companies. We also aimed for those stocks that have outperformed the benchmark, so we excluded those below the 52-week market performance of 3%.
Since we want our article to benefit income-seeking investors, we placed a dividend yield limit of a minimum of 2%. Above all, we included only those stocks with a beta of 0.5 or less. A higher beta suggests higher volatility in market events, which increases the potential risks. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 11, 2025. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield. We have also looked into the hedge fund backing the stock to estimate the institutional interests.

Is QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?,QCOM ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

Overall, QCOM ranks 7th on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

Is Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW) the Safest Dividend Stock to Buy Now?,PNW ,"We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) stands against other safest dividend stocks to buy now.
Today, in this article, we will be looking at the 10 safest dividend stocks you might be interested in adding to your portfolio.
The stock market has become increasingly volatile, constantly causing investors to look for stability. But few instruments offer stability as much as dividend-paying stocks.

With fresh trade tensions arising from unprecedented policy revisions from Washington, price appreciation alone may not be a dependable strategy for investors. Income-focused portfolios are becoming more than just a hedge. They are a necessity.
President Trump made a recent announcement, an update to the new tariff policies, whereby a whopping 145% rate is slapped on Chinese imports while maintaining a 10% baseline for other countries for 90 days. Negotiations are expected between the U.S. and other countries during this period, which, if they do not go well, will bring back the reciprocal tariffs originally announced on April 2, 2025. The announcement sent ripples once again across the global trade. All the major indices are struggling to find equilibrium in the middle of the uncertainty. The situation further raises the importance of stabilized equities that could remain immune to the market whiplash up to some level.
In this regard, safe dividend stocks provide income without compromising their defensiveness – qualities that are becoming harder to ignore in today’s time. Investments in dividend stocks are not just about cushioning against losses but also about long-term compounding and shareholder rewards. Investors prioritize dividends for the sake of sustainable yield that builds wealth gradually. Companies with strong dividend track records have historically stood against worse market conditions more effectively than their non-dividend counterparts. These stocks have safely harbored elevated capital inflow at times of increased volatility, indicating their trust in the broader market.
Recent market turmoil sees value-based investments in dividend-yielding equities becoming a compelling alternative to growth stocks investing among institutional players. Multiple strategists covered by CNBC noted portfolio managers pulling their investments from speculative names and diverting into more fundamentally grounded positions to overcome the unpredictable policy actions and inflation volatility.
But which dividend stocks to pick? Investors are facing not only economic cycles in today’s market environment but also political cycles. Trade, taxation, and regulation are politicized so that the markets are exposed to a profoundly impactful risk that cannot be quantified. It calls for a revisal of a portfolio that includes equities rooted in strong fundamentals and offers high yields.
With this in mind, our article will explore the 10 safest stocks investors could buy now to add resilience to their portfolios. Our curated selection is designed to offer consistent payouts and protect capital from the tremors induced by policies today. You might want to safeguard your capital, generate passive income, or just sleep better at night. Our picks in this article offer you all these in a market that is anything but predictable.
When assembling our list, we followed a few criteria to optimize our picks for the investors. Primarily, we included those stocks with a minimum market cap of $2 billion to ensure the financial soundness of the companies. We also aimed for those stocks that have outperformed the benchmark, so we excluded those below the 52-week market performance of 3%.
Since we want our article to benefit income-seeking investors, we placed a dividend yield limit of a minimum of 2%. Above all, we included only those stocks with a beta of 0.5 or less. A higher beta suggests higher volatility in market events, which increases the potential risks. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 11, 2025. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield. We have also looked into the hedge fund backing the stock to estimate the institutional interests.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

"Broadcom (AVGO) Sees 2025 Growth from AI Chips, VMware, Buybacks",AVGO ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMT) stands against other firms that defied the market slump and recorded double-digit gains last week.
The stock market may have taken a beating for most of the week, but it was able to recover losses on Friday, as investors gobbled up shares while weighing the impact of the US-China trade war.
Among all major indices, the tech-heavy Nasdaq registered the highest gain, up 7.29 percent, followed by the S&P 500 with 5.7 percent, and the Dow Jones by 4.95 percent.

Summit Therapeutics Inc. surged by 33.87 percent last week to end Friday’s trading at $23.24 each from the $17.36 the Friday prior as investors cheered two investment firms’ positive ratings for the company.
On Thursday, Cantor Fitzgerald maintained its Overweight rating on SMMT following a move by the company’s co-CEO and chairman Bob Duggan to exercise warrants to acquire 4 million SMMT shares.
The transaction was executed nearly four years before the warrants expired at a strike price of $1.58 apiece.
Meanwhile, Truist Securities also gave the company a Buy rating and a price target of $35, representing a 50.6-percent upside from SMMT’s latest closing price.

Overall, SMMT ranks 3rd on our list of firms that defied the market slump and recorded double-digit gains last week.

Why Hallador Energy Company (HNRG) Stock is Gaining This Week,HNRG ,"We recently compiled a list of the Energy Stocks that are Gaining This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG) stands against the other energy stocks.
The energy industry has found itself right in the crosshairs of President Trump’s tariff war, sliding more than 8% over the last five days, against a decline of just around 0.5% by the wider market. The global price of crude oil has plummeted by around 22% since the beginning of the year, with the WTI price currently hovering around the $60 mark. The primary reasons for this decline are the escalating US-China trade war, the high prospects of a global economic slowdown, and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May. The Trump administration has indicated a strong preference for reducing crude prices to $50 or lower, but whether this is actually possible remains to be seen, considering that the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
One sector that has garnered special attention from the White House is that of coal. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that aim to boost coal production, while another order asked the US Attorney General to identify state climate laws that stand in the way of developing energy resources like coal and try to stop them from being enforced. Following the President’s orders, the US Energy Department made $200 billion in financing available for its loan programs office including for new coal technologies. However, the orders have raised serious environmental concerns since coal is among the dirtiest fuels available to generate energy. It also remains to be seen whether there is any actual demand for increased coal output, since hundreds of coal-burning plants have already been shut down over the last decade.

To collect data for this article, we have referred to several stock screeners to find energy stocks that have surged the most between April 3 and April 10, 2025. Following are the Energy Stocks that Gained the Most This Week. The stocks are ranked according to their share price surge during this period.
At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).
Share Price Gains Between Apr. 3 – Apr. 10: 11.41%
With its roots in oil and gas exploration, Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG) has evolved to concentrate on coal development and transportation delivery.
The stock of Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG) has surged by more than 45% over the last month after the company posted a revenue of $404.4 million for FY 2024, topping estimates by $3.32 million. The stock has also benefited greatly from the recently signed order by President Trump to boost coal production in the US. Moreover, there has been news of recent insider buying activity, with HNRG director Wesley Charles Ray IV acquiring $103,978 worth of company shares this week.
Overall, HNRG ranks 4th on our list of the energy stocks that gained the most this week. While we acknowledge the potential of energy companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Here's How Much You'd Need to Put in Your Roth IRA to Save $1.46 Million in 35 Years,^GSPC ,"How much do you need to save for retirement? For most people, the initial answer is ""As much as possible."" While that knee-jerk response is suspiciously unspecific, it certainly makes sense. You arguably can't tuck away too much for retirement. The worst-case result of that is having more than you need, allowing you to give away any excess however you see fit.
For most ordinary investors, saving ""too much"" isn't going to be a problem. The worry is not saving enough.
One of the big keys to ensuring you're saving enough is setting a specific numeric goal, and then mathematically working your way backwards to a monthly investment that will allow you to reach that mark. Here's the number-crunching that will tell you how to amass a $1.46 million nest egg in a Roth IRA over the course of 35 years.
These numbers weren't randomly pulled out of a hat, by the way. They're relevant.
For instance, according to a 2024 survey performed by insurance and investment firm Northwestern Mutual, the average American thinks they'll need to save $1.46 million to secure a comfortable retirement. Given that this sum could reasonably generate on the order of $60,000 worth of reliable yearly investment income, this should be sufficient retirement income for most people when paired with whatever Social Security you're due.
As for the 35-year timeframe, that's a bit longer than most people typically work. But that's changing. Social Security's so-called full retirement age -- or FRA -- is now 67, giving people over 40 years' worth of adulthood to work before many of them will even be thinking about initiating benefits. People are also simply living longer, healthier lives, and choosing to remain in the workplace for personal productivity, if not for financial reasons. So collecting 35 years' worth of wages that can be used to fund an IRA is far from being unrealistic anymore.
What about a Roth IRA (as opposed to a traditional IRA)? Both would work, to be sure. Given the growing uncertainty of future income tax rates, though, there's a reason Roth IRAs are growing in popularity, even if they're still a minority of retirement accounts.
If some or none of these details apply to you, adjust accordingly. However, this is where most ordinary investors are during the early part of their wage-earning years, so this is a decent starting point for planning purposes.
Here's the number: Contributing $400 per month into a Roth IRA and investing that money in an instrument matching the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) average annual gain of 10% would leave you with just a little more than $1.5 million after 35 years.
Since this is a Roth account, not only has this growth been tax-free, any withdrawals from this IRA will also come out tax-free.
There's one important footnote to add here. That is, while $1.46 million is a reasonably healthy sum of money now, it won't necessarily be the small fortune then that it is today. Assuming just average inflation in the meantime, you'll actually want to amass nearly $4 million by then to have the same amount of buying power that $1.46 million provides right now.
On the other hand, this inflation also works in your favor. Regular pay raises will allow you to grow your monthly contribution from $400 now to a more significant amount in the future. So, that $4 million figure isn't nearly as out of reach as it seems and sounds like it is at this time.
It's also worth pointing out that while the hypothetical account above grew at a smooth and steady annual 10% pace, the market's far from being this consistent. Although you'll likely achieve similar net results with a long-term investment in the S&P 500, you won't be growing your account in the same straight line. Some years will be better than others. In some years you'll even lose ground, albeit temporarily.
But what if you don't even have $400 per month to put toward the effort right now, or maybe you don't have 35 years? That's OK on both fronts -- it just changes the numbers.
The big takeaway here isn't a magic formula for reaching the average American's retirement savings target of $1.46 million. You may be fine with less, or you may need even more.
The chief lesson here, rather, is to just do what you can as soon as you can, since time actually does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to growing a nest egg. For instance, in the example above, tucking away $400 per month for 35 years only translates into total personal contributions of $168,000. The other $1.3 million came from growth achieved on these invested contributions.
The key is just getting started how, when, and where you can, even if it seems like you're not saving enough money to matter yet. You are. Every little bit helps, and it helps even more the sooner you put this money to work.

"Is Walmart a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2025?",WMT ,"If you're unsure what to make of Walmart (NYSE: WMT), you're not alone. It's resilient, but certainly not immune to the effects of newly enacted tariffs. As CFO David Rainey recently noted: ""The range of outcomes for Q1 operating income growth has widened due to less favorable category mix, higher casualty claims expense and the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented.""
Translation? The retailer might be forced to spend a little more or accept narrower profit margins as a means of maintaining market share. The market sensed all this well before the statement was made, of course, which is why the stock is still well down from its February peak despite Wednesday's sizable surge.
Now, take an honest look at the bigger picture. Walmart is as strong as it's been since its heyday growth of the 1980s and 90s, and far better equipped to handle tariffs than the market's giving it credit for. That spells opportunity for investors.
Walmart is the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, with 10,771 locations. More than 5,200 of these are in the U.S., where more than 90% of the population lives within 10 miles of a store. It did $681 billion worth of business last fiscal year, up 5% from the previous year's top line.
Size isn't everything, though. In fact, it can be a liability simply because the bigger an organization gets, the more difficult it becomes to manage. Any tariff-related headaches, of course, only aggravate such unwieldiness.
However, Walmart isn't nearly as vulnerable to the latest round of tariff-prompted turbulence as it seems like it should be. Roughly two-thirds of what the company spends on inventory is spent on American-made products, for perspective. So, while Mexico and China supply a significant portion of the other one-third of its merchandise costs and many of its U.S. suppliers are certainly affected by tariffs, Walmart is far from being catastrophically undermined, despite much of the recent rhetoric.
The company's also been making moves that ultimately offer it a means of maintaining reasonably wide profit margins. Walmart now manages more than 20 private label brands of its own that each drive more than $1 billion in annual sales, five of which are each generating more than $5 billion worth of yearly revenue. These in-house goods essentially sidestep the wholesaling stage of the procurement process, making them cheaper to put on store shelves than nationally branded merchandise.
Walmart's resilience as an investment, however, is rooted in far more than a careful refinement of how and where it sources its inventory.
You could argue that Walmart's sheer size provides it with an unfair advantage over its competitors. And you'd be right. Investors don't want a fair fight, though. They want the companies they own to dominate their respective markets. Not only does this help keep competition in check, greater scale also allows an enterprise to operate more cost-effectively.
While e-commerce giant Amazon is now roughly the same size as Walmart in terms of total revenue, it's a somewhat misleading comparison. Less than half of Amazon's annual revenue stems from sales of physical products. The slightly bigger portion actually comes from subscription and service revenue, like Amazon Prime or its cloud computing business.
There's no denying that Walmart simply enjoys a physical reach that no brick-and-mortar competitor can match. Costco Wholesale only operates 890 locales, while Target's store count is less than 2,000. Given the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate that 84% of the country's retail spending is still done in store, this dominant market presence leaves Walmart very well-positioned for whatever the future holds on this front.
Bolstering this bullish argument is the fact that well over half of Walmart's business is groceries. This matters simply because -- regardless of any economic hardship -- people are going to need to eat. Many are going to lean on Walmart as their best bet for getting the most bang for their grocery buck, since the giant retailer is also better positioned than any other to push back on suppliers when its wholesale costs start to swell. The company's been doing exactly that for the past month, in fact.
Not only is Walmart likely to hold up to any brewing economic headwind, it might even thrive because of one. As Rainey commented at a recent investor event: ""We see opportunities to accelerate share gains while maintaining flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are applied to incoming goods.""
There's also the distinct possibility that the tariff war may end before it races out of control.
This bullish argument begs the question: Why is this stock down as much as it is since February's peak? The right answer is also the most obvious one. That is, most investors are jumping to broad, sweeping conclusions based on rhetoric without knowing all the relevant facts. Had they known most of the information laid out above, the crowd might not be nearly as quick to dump Walmart stock.
Someone else's mistake can mean opportunity for you, though. Walmart was already a compelling long-term prospect, but given the likelihood of 2025 results that will be far better than recently presumed, the stock's a strong buy sooner rather than later.
The analyst community thinks so, anyway. It's calling for sales growth of more than 4% this year and the year after that, which is impressive given its size and the industry's usually slow movement. Despite recent disruption, the vast majority of this crowd also still considers Walmart stock a strong buy, with a consensus price target of $109.08 that's more than 20% above the stock's present price. That's certainly not a bad way to start out a new trade.

Major analysts revamp gold price targets after historic rally,^GSPC ,"It’s been a very good time to be a gold bug. Gold has experienced a renaissance recently as investors have sought safe havens amid growing economic uncertainty following weaker U.S. economic data and an escalating trade war.
Gold prices have surged about 20% in 2025, including an impressive 10% return in April, largely after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2.

The rapid rise in gold prices is particularly intriguing to many investors, given the struggles of stocks and Treasury bonds. The S&P 500 is down 9% this year, while the 20-year Treasury Bond ETF  (TLT)  has lost 3.5% of its value this month.
Gold’s significant outperformance has caught the attention of major gold analysts, who recently reset their gold targets following the big move higher.
The U.S. economy was already experiencing signs of slowing down heading into this month’s big tariff announcement.
While unemployment remains historically low, it has increased to 4.2% from 3.5% in 2023, and there’s been an increase in layoffs lately. Over 497,000 people were laid off in the first quarter, the most in the quarter since 2009, and up 93% from Q1, 2024, according to Challenger, Gray, & Christmas.
Related: Jamie Dimon sends candid message on economy, stocks
We’ve also seen weaker manufacturing and services sector activity this year. ISM’s manufacturing index fell to 49 in March from 50.9 in December, and its services index slumped to 50.8, down from 54 in December. Readings below 50 are generally associated with a contracting economy.
Slowing economic data has the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecasting tool predicting negative 2.4% GDP growth in the first quarter. That number will likely change as more data is reported, but it still looks very likely that GDP will register meaningfully shy of the 3% pace seen last summer.
The new tariffs will likely compound problems. President Trump’s decision to impose import taxes on most countries of at least 10% is inflationary, as most companies will look to pass along higher costs to customers.
The problem is much worse for China's imports, given that an escalating trade war has erupted. U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are 145%, and China's tariffs on American imports are 125%. These levels are high enough to effectively shut down trade between the two giant economies.
The combination of weaker GDP and potentially sticky inflation has economists worried about stagflation, or worse, a recession.
Those concerns alone would make gold interesting to investors looking for potentially safer assets than stocks like precious metals or Treasury bonds.
The trade war, however, has made bonds less attractive. Thirty percent of treasuries are held by overseas buyers who are less inclined to finance our economy amid a trade war. The 10-year Treasury Bond has sold off sharply this month, sending the yield up to 4.5% from below 4% on April 4.
A similar situation is playing out with the U.S. Dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index DXY measures the value of the U.S. Dollar to a basket of major currencies. It’s down nearly 3.8% this month. Historically, gold has moved in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar because gold is dollar-denominated, meaning a weaker dollar makes buying gold more attractive to overseas investors.
Gold prices have soared to over $3,200 this month, an all-time high for the precious metal. It may have more room to continue higher, according to UBS and Deutsch Bank analysts.
Related: Mark Cuban makes shocking trade war prediction
UBS analysts say gold price increases will ""extend into next year and for prices to stabilize at higher levels further out."" Its current price target is $3,500 per ounce, citing declining demand for Treasuries and the U.S. Dollar. UBS 2025 gold target is the highest among major banks.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank is targeting $3,700 per ounce in 2026. Previously, analysts at the bank expected $2,900.
On Thursday, opening bids were placed for 400,000 ounces of gold valued at $1.3 billion in a daily auction favored by central banks and gold ETFs. According to Bloomberg, that was the largest volume since September 2019.

Is Tesla Stock Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire?,TSLA ,"Without a doubt, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is one of the most intriguing stocks on the market. The polemical views on the company portray it as either a damaged brand with an aging lineup of vehicles on the cusp of being exposed as a hugely overvalued car company -- or a technology company about to explode by unveiling its primary value creator, robotaxis, in due course. Here's the lowdown.
First up, some simple math to illustrate how Tesla might make you a millionaire. For the sake of argument, let's assume that Ark Invest's ""expected value"" price target of $2,600 for Tesla stock in 2029 comes true. Then you would have to hold 385 Tesla shares to have $1 million worth of stock. Buying those shares at the time of this writing would cost you just shy of $105,000.
Based on just the significant initial outlay required, Tesla stock is unlikely the best candidate for most individual retail investors to become eventual millionaires. Having said that, the stock still has the potential to generate hefty returns.
I reference Ark's valuation model because it highlights how investors perceive the stock differently. For bulls like Ark, the case for Tesla rests on its robotaxi offerings, which it attributes as being worth 88% of total company value, compared to just 9% for its electric vehicles.
That consideration goes a long way toward explaining why Tesla trades at nosebleed valuations compared with the more traditional automakers. Although Tesla is a highly successful EV company, the case for its stock lies in long-term revenue generation from profit sharing on miles driven on robotaxis, and the market knows it.
Let's put it this way: Under the Ark model, roughly $2,288 per share comes from robotaxis, and just $234 to Tesla as an EV company.
Consequently, investors need to accept the following:
Tesla will release its robotaxi service (possibly featuring its Cybercab) in due course. CEO Elon Musk maintains it will launch ""unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June.""
Tesla's purpose-built robotaxi, Cybercab, will begin volume production soon. Management maintains volume production will start in 2026.
Adoption will be rapid, regulatory hurdles will be overcome, and safety concerns will be reassured.
Tesla will be able to produce a low-cost Cybercab that can generate significantly lower cost per ride than alternatives like Waymo and traditional cab services.
The good news is investors have reason to be positive. First, while relatively high interest rates have negatively impacted automakers' EV plans, Tesla carried on investing and reduced its cost per vehicle to below $35,000 at the end of 2024 from above $38,000 at the start of 2023. That matters because EVs need to be affordable to encourage adoption, the Cybercab needs to be affordable, and management claims it will launch a new ""more affordable"" model in the first half of 2025.
Purely by way of contrast, consider that Ford (a company that told investors in 2016 that it would produce driverless cars by 2021) lost $5.1 billion on its EV segment in 2024.
Second, Tesla needs and has leadership in EVs. That's important for robotaxis because it means Tesla has a huge and continuously growing set of data from its Autopilot and Full-Service Driving (FSD) technology on Tesla cars in continuous use. That should enable it to lower the cost per ride and improve its unsupervised FSD solutions.
Third, while its declining sales in 2025 have attracted much media attention, the reality is that Tesla had more than 44% market share of EV sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company has the brand recognition and familiarity to succeed with robotaxis.
Unfortunately, while there are many positives, there are many question marks.
Most of the value in the stock is in a technology that's not in service yet. Tesla has a record of overpromising and underdelivering on unsupervised FSD and robotaxis/Cybercab. Will the Austin launch happen? Will the Cybercab be part of it, and will Cybercab be in volume production in 2026? Will the ""more affordable"" model be launched imminently? Will the tariff skirmish with China turn into a war and negatively impact Tesla's cost base, not least because it buys batteries and other components from China?
The upside is significant, but so are the risks, making Tesla a stock only for enterprising and speculative investors or those looking to take a relatively small position in a stock with substantive upside potential.
It won't suit most investors, and Tesla needs many things to go right before it realizes the potential in Robotaxis/Cybercab. It's not a millionaire maker because few retail investors will be willing to invest the sums necessary to get there, at least on Ark's model. Still, it might suit enterprising investors with a diversified portfolio of stocks who can tolerate risk.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

Middlemen Always Work.” – Jim Cramer’s Love for McKesson Corporation (MCK),MCK ,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.
“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”

Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said
“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”
Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.
“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’

McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) delivers healthcare services through the distribution of medicines, medical products, and logistics. It also provides technology, consulting, and support to healthcare providers, biopharma firms, and patients. Cramer commented, “Cencora and McKesson, you know those middlemen, they always work.”
Last week on Squawk on the Street, discussing McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), Cramer said:
“Can I give you the number one stock today? That’s not up enough yet? But people could go buy? McKesson. Because they actually got, the two Democrats on the FTC against them, I don’t know if they’ve been seen lately. . .McKesson is the big winner. They’re not gonna have any investigation. They can jack the prices up all they want… McKesson’s an amazing company. Nobody likes them except for their shareholders.”
Overall, MCK ranks 5th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of MCK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Today, in this article, we will be looking at the 10 safest dividend stocks you might be interested in adding to your portfolio.

With fresh trade tensions arising from unprecedented policy revisions from Washington, price appreciation alone may not be a dependable strategy for investors. Income-focused portfolios are becoming more than just a hedge. They are a necessity.
President Trump made a recent announcement, an update to the new tariff policies, whereby a whopping 145% rate is slapped on Chinese imports while maintaining a 10% baseline for other countries for 90 days. Negotiations are expected between the U.S. and other countries during this period, which, if they do not go well, will bring back the reciprocal tariffs originally announced on April 2, 2025. The announcement sent ripples once again across the global trade. All the major indices are struggling to find equilibrium in the middle of the uncertainty. The situation further raises the importance of stabilized equities that could remain immune to the market whiplash up to some level.
In this regard, safe dividend stocks provide income without compromising their defensiveness – qualities that are becoming harder to ignore in today’s time. Investments in dividend stocks are not just about cushioning against losses but also about long-term compounding and shareholder rewards. Investors prioritize dividends for the sake of sustainable yield that builds wealth gradually. Companies with strong dividend track records have historically stood against worse market conditions more effectively than their non-dividend counterparts. These stocks have safely harbored elevated capital inflow at times of increased volatility, indicating their trust in the broader market.
Recent market turmoil sees value-based investments in dividend-yielding equities becoming a compelling alternative to growth stocks investing among institutional players. Multiple strategists covered by CNBC noted portfolio managers pulling their investments from speculative names and diverting into more fundamentally grounded positions to overcome the unpredictable policy actions and inflation volatility.
But which dividend stocks to pick? Investors are facing not only economic cycles in today’s market environment but also political cycles. Trade, taxation, and regulation are politicized so that the markets are exposed to a profoundly impactful risk that cannot be quantified. It calls for a revisal of a portfolio that includes equities rooted in strong fundamentals and offers high yields.
With this in mind, our article will explore the 10 safest stocks investors could buy now to add resilience to their portfolios. Our curated selection is designed to offer consistent payouts and protect capital from the tremors induced by policies today. You might want to safeguard your capital, generate passive income, or just sleep better at night. Our picks in this article offer you all these in a market that is anything but predictable.
When assembling our list, we followed a few criteria to optimize our picks for the investors. Primarily, we included those stocks with a minimum market cap of $2 billion to ensure the financial soundness of the companies. We also aimed for those stocks that have outperformed the benchmark, so we excluded those below the 52-week market performance of 3%.
Since we want our article to benefit income-seeking investors, we placed a dividend yield limit of a minimum of 2%. Above all, we included only those stocks with a beta of 0.5 or less. A higher beta suggests higher volatility in market events, which increases the potential risks. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 11, 2025. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield. We have also looked into the hedge fund backing the stock to estimate the institutional interests.

"Is Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ) the Best Packaged Food Stock to Buy Now?",MDLZ ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Packaged Food Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) stands against other best packaged food stocks to buy now.
According to a report by Grand View Research, the US packaged food market had a size of $1.03 trillion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2022 and 2030. The primary growth drivers for the industry include the rising consumer inclination for convenience coupled with consumers’ hectic lives and work schedules. In addition, the rise in e-commerce sales in the US is another significant factor supporting the sale of packaged food nationwide. Growing innovation in plant-based products, food packaging, healthy ingredients, and bold flavors is expected to continue driving this growth in the United States in the coming years.

On April 8, BofA Securities analysts Bryan D. Spillane, Lisa K. Lewandowski, and Peter T. Galbo released their research findings on the consumer staples industry and their expected performance in case of a potential recession. The analysts iterated that in a majority of recent recessions, consumer staples have historically outperformed the S&P 500 as a sector. This trend points towards a defensive edge for the sector. However, the analysts also cautioned that current market conditions, including weak volume growth and lingering high prices, should be considered, as they may affect the sector’s resilience in a future downturn. Despite these concerns, consumer staples make up an appealing sector for investors and experts due to their limited exposure to the recently imposed tariffs, potentially helping sustain valuation multiples.
During recessions, the stock prices in the consumer staples sector are typically affected by earnings per share (EPS) instead of sales growth. Yahoo! Finance reported that sector analysis highlights forward EPS accounting for more than 90% of stock price movement across central subsectors, including Packaged Food, Beverages, Household and Personal Care, and Tobacco. The analysts also opined that these trends reflect the significance of earnings strength when determining stock performance in volatile and uncertain economic conditions.
Yahoo! Finance further reported that the top-performing stocks in the consumer staples sector are likely to share three common traits. These include solid balance sheets with the potential to sustain share buybacks to boost EPS, profit flexibility to offset increasing costs and revenue pressure, and a strong manufacturing presence in the US to constrain tariff-related inflation.
We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 packaged food stocks and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.

As per Straits Research, the US semiconductor manufacturing equipment market size was pegged at US$13.2 billion in 2024. It is expected to grow from US$13.5 billion in 2025 to US$16.5 billion by 2033. This growth is expected to stem from increasing investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the higher demand for advanced semiconductors in critical sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and EVs.
Straits Research highlighted that the resurgence of semiconductor manufacturing in the US is aided by the government initiatives. The federal push is targeted at reducing the dependency on Asian imports as well as strengthening the domestic supply chains.

“Balance Sheet to Win… But I’m Concerned!” – Jim Cramer on Walmart (WMT)’s,WMT ,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.
“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”

Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said
“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”
Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.
“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’
For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.

Cramer mentioned that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is among the “big three” retailers as he remarked:
“Finally, and most obviously, there are three retailers with the balance sheets to win and to own. It’s Amazon, Walmart, and Costco. Take a look around at all the other retailers. They could be in their death rows, death by withdrawal. With the exception of the two big box hardware stores, I don’t know how they can make it if they’re up against those big three.”
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is a retail company that sells a broad selection of products, including food, health-related items, electronics, apparel, and its own store brands. Appearing on Squawk on the Street in March, Cramer said:
“[On MS commenting that lower income buying rates at Walmart, Dollar General going down] They are are going down. I am concerned about Walmart’s quarter. But the stock has reflected some decline. I am concerned about people who go to the dollar stores. Because when you look at the average. . .you don’t end up being as a good a bargain as you may think. That’s been my experience. Was the Dollar Tree stores do not represent. . . by the way, Family Dollar, jeez you know for years they told me it was good.”

Is Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?,DELL ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

For this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Information Technology index, which tracks the performance of major tech companies. From there, we identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders and picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.

Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) is a Texas-based multinational tech company that specializes in a wide variety of computer hardware and software products. Sales of AI servers are projected to surge nearly sixfold between 2024 and 2030, potentially reaching $838 billion in yearly revenue by the end of the decade. Dell currently leads the server market, holding an estimated 7.2% share in the fourth quarter of 2024. This rising demand for AI servers significantly boosted Dell’s infrastructure business in fiscal 2025, with revenue from that segment climbing 29% year over year to $43.6 billion.
In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2025, Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) reported revenue of $23.9 billion, up 7% from the same period last year. Its operating income for the quarter came in at $2.2 billion, which grew by 40% on a YoY basis. The company generated over $4.5 billion in operating cash flow, and its free cash flow amounted to over $3 billion.
On March 18, Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) announced an 18% boost to its annual cash dividend, bringing it to an anticipated $2.10 per common share. The first quarterly payment of $0.525 per share is scheduled for May 2, 2025, for shareholders on record as of April 22, 2025. Alongside this, the board of directors approved a $10 billion expansion of the company’s share repurchase program. With a dividend yield of 2.66%, as of April 10, DELL is one of the best dividend stocks from the tech sector.
Overall, DELL ranks 10th on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR): Report Reveals Bold IRS AI Overhaul Plan with Elon Musk’s DOGE Team,PLTR ,"We recently published a list of 14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention.
In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution.
OpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology.
Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity.
OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion.

“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,”
In response, Musk’s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI.
“Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It’s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI’s assets allegedly ‘interferes’ with their business plans.”
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.

Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading provider of artificial intelligence systems. On April 11, an article by Wired revealed that Palantir is reportedly working with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on a major IRS project. This collaboration will allow it to build a new “mega API” for accessing Internal Revenue Service records. IRS sources told Wired that DOGE, a few of Palantir representatives, and dozens of career IRS engineers have been collaborating to build a single API layer above all IRS databases for the past few days. DOGE would like Palantir’s Foundry software to become the “read center of all IRS systems,” in case the project moves forward. This implies anyone with access could view and possess the ability to possibly modify all IRS data in one place.
Overall, PLTR ranks 13th on our list of AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

"Amazon.com (AMZN) Bets $8B on Anthropic, Expands AI in AWS & Shopping",AMZN ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

In September 2023, Amazon announced an initial investment of $1.25 billion in Anthropic, with an option to increase this investment up to $4 billion. By November 2024, Amazon had invested an additional $4 billion in Anthropic, bringing its total investment to $8 billion. As of December 2024, the company’s stake in Anthropic was valued at approximately $14 billion, reflecting a 75% gain from the initial investment.

Clorox Australia fined $5.2 million over false claims of using recycled plastic,CLX ,"(Reuters) -Australia's competition regulator said on Monday Clorox's local unit had been fined A$8.25 million ($5.19 million) by the Federal Court over falsely claiming its GLAD kitchen and garbage bags were partially made from recycled ocean plastic.
The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said the U.S.-based cleaning products maker admitted to breaching the Australian Consumer Law from June 2021 to July 2023 by falsely claiming on its ""GLAD"" kitchen and garbage bags that these were made of at least half recycled oceanic plastic waste.
In reality, over 2.2 million of these bags were made of approximately 50% plastic waste collected from Indonesian communities without formal waste management systems, and up to 50 kilometers from any shoreline, ACCC added.
The court ruling comes amid a broader societal focus on environmental impact and sustainability, with misleading 'green' claims potentially eroding consumer trust and creating unfair market conditions.
The court noted that claims of environmental friendliness were crucial in assessing the violating conduct.
Clorox was also directed to establish an Australian Consumer Law compliance program, publish a corrective notice on its website, and bear a portion of the ACCC's legal costs, according to the regulator's statement.
The company ceased the production of the products in question in July 2023 after the ACCC initiated its investigation.
Clorox did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

3 Reasons Dutch Bros Is the Stock to Watch in 2025,BROS ,"Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) has quickly become one of the most exciting names in the food and beverage industry. While more prominent players like Starbucks dominate the market, Dutch Bros has carved out its niche with a unique drive-thru model and an intensely loyal customer base.
But what makes Dutch Bros a stock to watch for the long run? Here are three key reasons this fast-growing coffee chain is worth investors' attention.
Dutch Bros isn't just another coffee company -- it has revolutionized the drive-thru coffee experience. Unlike traditional sit-down cafes, Dutch Bros focuses on speed, efficiency, and customer experience, allowing it to serve more customers per hour. Such an approach delights customers and also generates a good return on investment for the company.
Besides, the coffee chain is well known for its customizable drinks, particularly its cold and ice-blended beverages. Personalized beverages align with younger consumers' preferences and differentiate them from competitors. In 2024, cold beverages accounted for 94% of all drinks sold to Generation Z. The company has also moved beyond its early roots of serving coffee-based beverages to other products such as energy drinks and refreshments.
Beyond serving great beverages fast, the food company also focuses on building a loyal customer base. It relies on strategies like excellent customer service, community building via social media, and a loyalty system to reward customers. As a result, 71% of its transactions in the fourth quarter of 2024 went through the loyalty program, up from 44% in the first quarter of 2021.
Its highly efficient operating structure, differentiated product offerings, and loyal customer base explain its solid track record of growth. In the last five years, store count grew by 42% on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR), and revenue expanded by 50%.
While many restaurant chains struggle with high overhead costs and long capital payback periods, Dutch Bros stores deliver strong financial performance with an efficient cost structure and fast profitability.
Let's look at some quick numbers. The company expects to spend $1.25 million on capex for each new store in the future, with an expected annual sale of $1.8 million per new store in the second year of operation. With a targeted shop contribution of 30%, the return on investment is around 43%, giving it a payback of just slightly above two years. Note: Shop contribution is defined as gross profit plus depreciation.
Dutch Bros' solid return on investment is not without reason. One thing is that, unlike traditional coffee shops, Dutch Bros stores are smaller and require fewer employees, which keeps operating expenses lower. A low capex and relatively low overhead allow the company to generate strong store-level margins early on.
Besides, the beverage company has a proven track record of delivering same-store sales growth (SSSG) over time. For perspective, stores opened in 2020 and prior delivered 4.6% SSSG in 2024, and newer stores did even better, reaching 13.7% for those stores opened in 2023. SSSG will further enhance the return on investment in older stores.
These factors should sustain Dutch Bros' excellent store economics for the foreseeable future.
Dutch Bros has already proven its business model and store economics. The focus is on scaling up and expanding the business into new markets and products.
The company currently has just under 1,000 stores across 18 states. Over time, it expects to add another 3,500 stores in existing states and also expand into other new regions, particularly on the East Coast. In 2025 alone, it plans to add at least 160 stores in existing and new areas. If successful, this latest expansion will quadruple the store count in the coming years.
However, that's just one part of the story. It is actively adding new SKUs to its menu to grow SSSG, particularly focusing on food products. For perspective, Dutch Bros' food sales in 2024 are less than 2% of revenue, much lower than its industry peer, where food accounts for around a quarter of the sales. Expanding its food menu presents a major opportunity for increasing same-store sales.
Another area that could see good growth is the energy drinks segment, which is expected to grow faster than the coffee industry. With around 25 % of its sales from customized energy drinks, Dutch Bros is well positioned to benefit from this trend.
Overall, the food company expects to grow its top line by 20% in the coming years, with new stores growing at a mid-teens growth rate and SSSG in the low digits.
It is not difficult to see why Dutch Bros could be a great growth stock. It has a proven operating model, solid store economics, and a long growth runway.
Unsurprisingly, the stock doesn't come cheap -- as of writing, it has a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 179.
It will be best to keep the stock on the radar and wait for a more reasonable entry price.

American Airlines (AAL): Among Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Top Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential,AAL ,"We recently published a list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Top 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) stands against other Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s top stock picks with huge upside potential.
Wall Street is overflowing with data. If companies are not releasing their earnings, economic data flows almost daily. This abundance of data can be overwhelming, making it easy to miss important signals. That’s why investors monitor billionaires who’ve made and continue to make their fortunes on Wall Street. The list of these billionaires is long, but a few, such as Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller, stand out.
Druckenmiller is a former Soros protégé who, after 12 years at Soros Fund Management, opted to exit and focus fully on his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital, in 2000. He later transitioned this outfit into a family office – Duquesne Family Office – in 2010. Over the past eight quarters (up to Q4 2024), the family office has consistently outperformed the S&P 500. The top 20 holdings weighted have returned 81.63% in three years (cumulatively) and 22.01% (annualized).

This billionaire is widely respected across Wall Street for many things, but most of all, his market acumen, integrity, and agility. One should recall that he was part of the Soros Fund Management crew that shorted the British pound in the early 1990s to the point of almost breaking the Bank of England. His genius in the market has been noticed by many. Ken Langone, another billionaire, described Druckenmiller as the best investor he’s ever known.
Druckenmiller is also influential. The Financial Times reports that the veteran investor could significantly influence the direction of the current US government economic policies. Scott Bessent, the current Treasury secretary, and Kevin Warsh, a possible successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, are Druckenmiller’s proteges. According to the FT, these three “have a great relationship”, which implies that Druckenmiller has a direct line to the country’s most crucial economic thinkers.
Druckenmiller’s investing strategy is to chase value over hype. In other words, the 71-year-old billionaire focuses on investing in undervalued stocks rather than jumping on trendy ones. Simply put, he prefers solid opportunities over flashy ones. Just recently, he exited two of the most high-profile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. This is an eye-brow-raising move, but if the billionaire’s genius is anything to go by, there must be value he is chasing.
To compile this list, we reviewed the Duquesne Family Office’s SEC Q4 2024 13F filings. We picked 10 stocks that have the highest upside potential from their current levels based on average analyst price targets (as of April 11). Finally, we organized the stocks in ascending order based on their highest analyst upside potential while also outlining hedge fund sentiment regarding these stocks as of Q4 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) offers passenger flights, cargo services, loyalty programs, and airport lounges to clients from across six continents. It serves more than 350 destinations across more than 60 countries.
In Q4 2024, the airline reported a record quarterly revenue of $13.7 billion. The full-year income was also record-setting, coming in at $54.2 billion. More importantly, the carrier generated $4 billion in full-year operating cash flow and a record free cash flow of $2.2 billion. According to management, the healthy financial figures are a result of successfully re-engineering the airline business.
Commenting on the results, the company’s CEO Robert Isom said: “The American Airlines team achieved several important objectives in 2024. We continue to run a reliable operation, and we are reengineering the business to build an even more efficient airline. That, coupled with our commercial actions, resulted in strong financial performance in the fourth quarter.”
The airline is also expanding its international presence for winter 2025-2026. It recently announced five new routes to Cancun, Mexico, and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, starting in November and December 2025. The company will operate more than 270 peak daily departures to beach destinations across Mexico, the Caribbean, and Latin America — more than any other airline. Additionally, the carrier is resuming service to Kona, Hawaii, and extending seasonal service on select European routes.
Overall, AAL ranks 9th on our list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s top stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of AAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

"Why PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) is the Best Packaged Food Stock to Buy Now",PEP ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Packaged Food Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best packaged food stocks to buy now.
According to a report by Grand View Research, the US packaged food market had a size of $1.03 trillion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2022 and 2030. The primary growth drivers for the industry include the rising consumer inclination for convenience coupled with consumers’ hectic lives and work schedules. In addition, the rise in e-commerce sales in the US is another significant factor supporting the sale of packaged food nationwide. Growing innovation in plant-based products, food packaging, healthy ingredients, and bold flavors is expected to continue driving this growth in the United States in the coming years.

On April 8, BofA Securities analysts Bryan D. Spillane, Lisa K. Lewandowski, and Peter T. Galbo released their research findings on the consumer staples industry and their expected performance in case of a potential recession. The analysts iterated that in a majority of recent recessions, consumer staples have historically outperformed the S&P 500 as a sector. This trend points towards a defensive edge for the sector. However, the analysts also cautioned that current market conditions, including weak volume growth and lingering high prices, should be considered, as they may affect the sector’s resilience in a future downturn. Despite these concerns, consumer staples make up an appealing sector for investors and experts due to their limited exposure to the recently imposed tariffs, potentially helping sustain valuation multiples.
During recessions, the stock prices in the consumer staples sector are typically affected by earnings per share (EPS) instead of sales growth. Yahoo! Finance reported that sector analysis highlights forward EPS accounting for more than 90% of stock price movement across central subsectors, including Packaged Food, Beverages, Household and Personal Care, and Tobacco. The analysts also opined that these trends reflect the significance of earnings strength when determining stock performance in volatile and uncertain economic conditions.
Yahoo! Finance further reported that the top-performing stocks in the consumer staples sector are likely to share three common traits. These include solid balance sheets with the potential to sustain share buybacks to boost EPS, profit flexibility to offset increasing costs and revenue pressure, and a strong manufacturing presence in the US to constrain tariff-related inflation.
We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 packaged food stocks and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.

Is Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN) the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?,TXN ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) earns most of its revenue through two main segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. One of its key strengths lies in its in-house manufacturing operations, which give the company greater control over production and its supply chain.
Over the past year, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) has focused on how it allocates capital to sustain a healthy free cash flow.

Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) has cemented its leadership position in the semiconductor industry.

During the fourth quarter alone, it returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends.
Overall, TXN ranks 8th on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Is NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) a NASDAQ Stock with the Highest Upside Potential?,NVDA ,"We recently published a list of the 13 NASDAQ Stocks with the Highest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other NASDAQ stocks with high upside potential.
On April 7, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss how the current tariff environment could impact tech supply chains. Musk’s actions and Trump’s tariffs have contributed to broad economic uncertainty, which Ives also referred to as the economic Armageddon for US tech in an earlier conversation. He expressed concern about the structural supply chain challenges posed by recent tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Ives highlighted that the US tech sector has historically maintained an edge over China but this could be wiped out if manufacturing were relocated to the US. The logistical hurdles of building manufacturing plants in the US are not negligible and it would take 4 to 5 years to establish facilities capable of sustaining production levels comparable to those in Asia.
He also acknowledged that he hasn’t downgraded major stocks like the ones in MAG7 but remains cautious. If these previously highlighted issues persist for months, Ives anticipates drastic cuts in earnings. This uncertainty surrounding tariffs could lead to lower demand for emerging technologies like AI and cybersecurity. He explained that this situation could severely impact the US tech companies and lead to broader cuts across the tech sector — potentially up to 25% in earnings. He also criticized Elon Musk’s political involvement, which he believes has caused permanent damage to his brand and customer base. He estimated a 20% demand destruction in Europe and 10% in the US.

NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that offers graphics and compute & networking solutions. It sells its products to various parties such as OEMs, original device manufacturers, system integrators & distributors, independent software vendors, cloud service providers, and consumer internet companies.
In the full fiscal year 2025, the company’s total revenue doubled year-over-year to generate $115.2 billion. Blackwell sales alone, which supported this growth majorly, reached $11 billion in the last quarter of FY25. Blackwell is deployed by major cloud providers like Azure and AWS and is designed for AI inference, with 25x higher throughput and 20x lower cost than the previously made models.
Some of its popular AI-driven solutions include platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On April 3, HSBC analyst Frank Lee downgraded the company from Buy to Hold and lowered his price target on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $120 to $55 potential. Still, the company now expects FQ1 2026 revenue to reach $43 billion.
Guinness Global Innovators is positive on the company due to its dominant AI chip market position and stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“For a second year running, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund’s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‘Hopper’ GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia’s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to “inference” (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia’s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia’s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia’s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia’s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure.

"Is Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?",NFLX ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.
To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Is CMS Energy Corporation (CMS) the Safest Dividend Stock to Buy Now?,CMS ,"We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CMS Energy Corporation (NYSE:CMS) stands against other safest dividend stocks to buy now.
Today, in this article, we will be looking at the 10 safest dividend stocks you might be interested in adding to your portfolio.
The stock market has become increasingly volatile, constantly causing investors to look for stability. But few instruments offer stability as much as dividend-paying stocks.

With fresh trade tensions arising from unprecedented policy revisions from Washington, price appreciation alone may not be a dependable strategy for investors. Income-focused portfolios are becoming more than just a hedge. They are a necessity.
President Trump made a recent announcement, an update to the new tariff policies, whereby a whopping 145% rate is slapped on Chinese imports while maintaining a 10% baseline for other countries for 90 days. Negotiations are expected between the U.S. and other countries during this period, which, if they do not go well, will bring back the reciprocal tariffs originally announced on April 2, 2025. The announcement sent ripples once again across the global trade. All the major indices are struggling to find equilibrium in the middle of the uncertainty. The situation further raises the importance of stabilized equities that could remain immune to the market whiplash up to some level.
In this regard, safe dividend stocks provide income without compromising their defensiveness – qualities that are becoming harder to ignore in today’s time. Investments in dividend stocks are not just about cushioning against losses but also about long-term compounding and shareholder rewards. Investors prioritize dividends for the sake of sustainable yield that builds wealth gradually. Companies with strong dividend track records have historically stood against worse market conditions more effectively than their non-dividend counterparts. These stocks have safely harbored elevated capital inflow at times of increased volatility, indicating their trust in the broader market.
Recent market turmoil sees value-based investments in dividend-yielding equities becoming a compelling alternative to growth stocks investing among institutional players. Multiple strategists covered by CNBC noted portfolio managers pulling their investments from speculative names and diverting into more fundamentally grounded positions to overcome the unpredictable policy actions and inflation volatility.
But which dividend stocks to pick? Investors are facing not only economic cycles in today’s market environment but also political cycles. Trade, taxation, and regulation are politicized so that the markets are exposed to a profoundly impactful risk that cannot be quantified. It calls for a revisal of a portfolio that includes equities rooted in strong fundamentals and offers high yields.
With this in mind, our article will explore the 10 safest stocks investors could buy now to add resilience to their portfolios. Our curated selection is designed to offer consistent payouts and protect capital from the tremors induced by policies today. You might want to safeguard your capital, generate passive income, or just sleep better at night. Our picks in this article offer you all these in a market that is anything but predictable.
When assembling our list, we followed a few criteria to optimize our picks for the investors. Primarily, we included those stocks with a minimum market cap of $2 billion to ensure the financial soundness of the companies. We also aimed for those stocks that have outperformed the benchmark, so we excluded those below the 52-week market performance of 3%.
Since we want our article to benefit income-seeking investors, we placed a dividend yield limit of a minimum of 2%. Above all, we included only those stocks with a beta of 0.5 or less. A higher beta suggests higher volatility in market events, which increases the potential risks. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 11, 2025. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield. We have also looked into the hedge fund backing the stock to estimate the institutional interests.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Is AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) the Best Stock for 15 Years?,ABBV ,"We recently published a list of Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 15 Best Stocks for 15 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) stands against other best stocks for 15 years.
Russell Investments believes that 3 features are defining the market outlook for 2025. These include the elevated level of the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio, the potential for further US dollar strength, as well as the direction of the US 10-year Treasury yield. The active equity managers have been challenged by the severe market concentration. The firm opines that a flattening out of such trends— which can be seen due to policy shifts or change in sentiments related to earnings growth and valuations for mega caps — can support active manager outperformance.
Russell Investments remains focused on sectors in which AI adoption has been ramping up, including industrials, healthcare, and consumer goods. As per the firm, companies that leverage AI for productivity improvements remain well-placed to gain a lasting competitive edge and provide healthy returns. Therefore, skilled active managers are required to look for such companies, primarily those that are in less-covered segments of the market.

With respect to real assets, Russell Investments sees attractive investment opportunities in real estate and infrastructure, mainly sectors that can benefit from the stabilization of long-term interest rates and favorable relative valuations in comparison to other growth assets. The application of AI in real estate, like data centers and healthcare facilities, continues to emerge as a critical growth area. Furthermore, the infrastructure investments continue to gain momentum from energy utilities and pipeline exposures, given the US administration’s emphasis on expanding LNG (liquified natural gas) production.
The firm also believes that an early focus on deregulation and tax cuts would likely be well-received by equity investors. Overall, an expected US soft landing, together with anticipated policy moderation on trade and immigration, creates specific opportunities for well-positioned portfolios, says Russell Investments.

"Is Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL) Among the Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?",TOL ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.
Golf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.
The golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.
According to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.
Finally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum.
Marc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:
“The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.”
The exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.
Technology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf’s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show’s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success.

Then, we selected the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential as of April 9, 2025. We have only included stocks in our list with an upside potential of 10% or higher. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).
Analysts’ Upside Potential as of April 9: 51.13%
Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is next on our list of the Best Golf Stocks. The company creates communities with leisure features like golf courses. The firm takes great satisfaction in owning a sizable portion of some of the best land in the business. Premier land inventory, paired with luxurious, customizable designs, enables the company to charge industry-leading average selling prices (compared to public peers).
Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) experienced exceptional growth in the first quarter, signing 2,307 net contracts worth $2.3 billion, representing a 13% surge in units and a 12% increase in dollar value over the previous year. Buyer commitment remained strong, with a low contract cancellation rate of 2.4% of the initial backlog. Profitability improved as the adjusted gross margin rose to 26.9%, topping expectations by 65 basis points. Furthermore, the deposit conversion ratio was 82%, surpassing the five-year average of 70%, showing outstanding customer follow-through. The firm retained a strong land position, owning or controlling roughly 56,000 lots, with 56% under option, providing flexibility in land acquisitions.
To bolster its financial position, the business extended the maturities of its credit facilities until February 2030 and increased the size of its revolving credit facility to $2.35 billion, therefore improving liquidity and long-term financial stability.
Baron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“As noted earlier in this letter, we chose to decrease the Fund’s homebuilder exposure in D.R. Horton, Inc., Lennar Corporation, and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in the most recent quarter following exceptional share price performance over the prior two years. From September 30, 2022, through September 30, 2024, shares of Toll Brothers, Lennar, and D.R. Horton increased 269%, 155%, and 184%, respectively. Homebuilder valuations for our investments had approached near peak valuations from prior cycles (at or above 2 times tangible book value). We also have concerns that the recent 100 basis point increase in interest rates will further crimp housing affordability. This could lead to flattening home prices and elevated homebuilder incentives to entice buyers to purchase a home. Further, the new administration policy decisions around tariffs, immigration, and deportation may increase the cost for labor and materials. The issues cited above may lead to pressure on homebuilder gross margins in 2025.
Overall, TOL ranks 3rd on our list of the 10 best golf stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of golf companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TOL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

"Why Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN) is the Best Packaged Food Stock to Buy Now",TSN ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Packaged Food Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stands against other best packaged food stocks to buy now.
According to a report by Grand View Research, the US packaged food market had a size of $1.03 trillion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2022 and 2030. The primary growth drivers for the industry include the rising consumer inclination for convenience coupled with consumers’ hectic lives and work schedules. In addition, the rise in e-commerce sales in the US is another significant factor supporting the sale of packaged food nationwide. Growing innovation in plant-based products, food packaging, healthy ingredients, and bold flavors is expected to continue driving this growth in the United States in the coming years.

On April 8, BofA Securities analysts Bryan D. Spillane, Lisa K. Lewandowski, and Peter T. Galbo released their research findings on the consumer staples industry and their expected performance in case of a potential recession. The analysts iterated that in a majority of recent recessions, consumer staples have historically outperformed the S&P 500 as a sector. This trend points towards a defensive edge for the sector. However, the analysts also cautioned that current market conditions, including weak volume growth and lingering high prices, should be considered, as they may affect the sector’s resilience in a future downturn. Despite these concerns, consumer staples make up an appealing sector for investors and experts due to their limited exposure to the recently imposed tariffs, potentially helping sustain valuation multiples.
During recessions, the stock prices in the consumer staples sector are typically affected by earnings per share (EPS) instead of sales growth. Yahoo! Finance reported that sector analysis highlights forward EPS accounting for more than 90% of stock price movement across central subsectors, including Packaged Food, Beverages, Household and Personal Care, and Tobacco. The analysts also opined that these trends reflect the significance of earnings strength when determining stock performance in volatile and uncertain economic conditions.
Yahoo! Finance further reported that the top-performing stocks in the consumer staples sector are likely to share three common traits. These include solid balance sheets with the potential to sustain share buybacks to boost EPS, profit flexibility to offset increasing costs and revenue pressure, and a strong manufacturing presence in the US to constrain tariff-related inflation.
We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 packaged food stocks and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.

AMD (AMD) Projects Double-Digit Growth on AI-Driven $26B Revenue,AMD ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

For this article, we consulted an internal database on AI companies. From these, we selected the thirty stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. The company is heavily invested in the AI boom, with more than 50% of annual revenue coming from the data center portfolio. After posting record annual revenue of close to $26 billion in 2024, the firm expects Q1 2025 revenue of approximately $7.1 billion, slightly down sequentially but up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in the data center and client businesses. The company also anticipates double-digit revenue and EPS growth for 2025, driven by continued momentum in the data center GPU and CPU businesses. Investment advisory KeyBanc recently downgraded the stock to Sector Weight from Overweight, citing concerns about the sustainability of its China AI business.
Overall, AMD ranks 11th on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of these AI companies, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Is Nvidia a Buy?,NVDA ,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), an icon in the world of artificial intelligence (AI), has generated huge wealth for its long-term shareholders. In just the last five years, its shares have surged 1,610% (as of April 9), driven by ridiculous demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). This trend shows no sign of slowing down. 
However, things haven't been so smooth for its investors over the past few months. At the time of this writing, the AI stock is trading about 24% off the all-time high it hit in January amid a volatile market sell-off. But when pessimism and fear are in the air, some stocks can become oversold. Could that be the case here? Is Nvidia a no-brainer buying opportunity right now?
Training and powering all the AI models that have hit the market requires advanced computing solutions. Nvidia sells the GPUs that provide just the sort of high-speed computational power those applications demand. In its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 26, 91% of its revenue came from the data center segment, which is experiencing a massive surge in demand. Nvidia has taken a commanding lead in the AI chip segment, where it holds the vast majority of the market.
Nvidia's growth trajectory will probably be the subject of numerous business school case studies in the future. Its revenue increased 78% from $22.1 billion in its fiscal 2024 Q4 to $39.3 billion in its most recently ended fiscal quarter. This was supported by cloud infrastructure providers that are boosting their AI capabilities to better serve their customers. Nvidia's revenue in its fiscal 2025 was 12-fold higher than just five years before.
If you think Nvidia's top-line growth is impressive, look further down the income statement. This insanely profitable company's net income in the fourth quarter was 56% of sales. The operating leverage inherent in this business model is clear.
A company doesn't reach a $2.4 trillion market cap without doing some things right. There are important factors that position Nvidia well in its industry.
The first is its ability to innovate. Nvidia has historically introduced new GPU architectures at a rapid pace. Before it debuted its current cutting-edge Blackwell architecture, its Hopper and Lovelace lines were the best-in-class offerings of their periods, catering to the needs of customers and providing tangible improvement upon previous GPU generations. 
Nvidia has also developed a wide and multifaceted economic moat. One factor in its economic advantage is its unmatched technological know-how in terms of GPU design, in addition to the tools needed for developers to use this hardware. This has given it a huge lead in the industry.
Another area of competitive strength comes from its CUDA software platform -- a computing platform and application programming interface that allows developers to get the most speed and power out of its GPUs, and make it easier for AI experts to develop models. The result is that Nvidia also benefits from switching costs. CUDA only works with Nvidia's hardware. Developers who become expert in programming on that proprietary platform will be less likely to want to buy competitors' chips.
Apple has become arguably the world's most successful company because it has developed a beautiful balance between its hardware and software offerings. Nvidia is doing something similar.
Despite these positive characteristics, Nvidia still faces some noteworthy financial risks. Top hyperscaler clients like Amazon and Alphabet are working on their own AI accelerator chips. 
What's more, it's easy to imagine that Nvidia's revenue could take a severe hit in an economic downturn. A substantial amount of money is being spent on AI. Some of these capital outlays will likely be delayed or canceled in a recession.
President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff announcements and threats have sent shock waves through the global financial markets. Tech stocks have taken some of the biggest hits. The ""Magnificent Seven"" are all trading well off their peaks. It looks like the narrative of the AI boom is looking less compelling in the face of broader macroeconomic concerns.
Yet Nvidia's valuation might be too tempting to ignore. The stock trades right now at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 25. It has rarely been close to that cheap in the past couple of years. It can be mentally challenging to buy shares in AI companies when macro conditions are so volatile and uncertain. However, increasing your portfolio's exposure to the AI trend by opening a small position in the leading GPU provider now makes sense.
Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

"Is Mattel, Inc. (MAT) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?",MAT ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.
To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) is expected to have a turbulent 2025, with inflation forecast to slow down consumer spending on toys.

(NASDAQ:MAT) has a twelve-month average trading share price of $25.58, an upside of 74.55%.
Overall, MAT ranks 10th on our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.

Is Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) a NASDAQ Stock with the Highest Upside Potential?,MRVL ,"We recently published a list of the 13 NASDAQ Stocks with the Highest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) stands against other NASDAQ stocks with high upside potential.
On April 7, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss how the current tariff environment could impact tech supply chains. Musk’s actions and Trump’s tariffs have contributed to broad economic uncertainty, which Ives also referred to as the economic Armageddon for US tech in an earlier conversation. He expressed concern about the structural supply chain challenges posed by recent tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Ives highlighted that the US tech sector has historically maintained an edge over China but this could be wiped out if manufacturing were relocated to the US. The logistical hurdles of building manufacturing plants in the US are not negligible and it would take 4 to 5 years to establish facilities capable of sustaining production levels comparable to those in Asia.
He also acknowledged that he hasn’t downgraded major stocks like the ones in MAG7 but remains cautious. If these previously highlighted issues persist for months, Ives anticipates drastic cuts in earnings. This uncertainty surrounding tariffs could lead to lower demand for emerging technologies like AI and cybersecurity. He explained that this situation could severely impact the US tech companies and lead to broader cuts across the tech sector — potentially up to 25% in earnings. He also criticized Elon Musk’s political involvement, which he believes has caused permanent damage to his brand and customer base. He estimated a 20% demand destruction in Europe and 10% in the US.

"1 Surprising Reason to Buy Bitcoin, According to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink",^GSPC ,"If you're new to crypto, here's one idea you might not have heard before: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) could be ready to challenge the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. That type of transformative change, of course, would be history-making, and it would require a fundamental restructuring of the global financial system -- sort of like we're seeing right now, with tariffs and the potential for a global trade war.
In his annual letter to investors this year, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) CEO and Chairman, Larry Fink, suggested that Bitcoin had the potential to replace the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. Is that scenario really possible? And if it is, what does it mean for Bitcoin's future?
There's obviously a lot to unpack here. The first is the entire notion of what a reserve currency should be, and what role it plays in the global economy. The easiest way to think about a reserve currency is that it is the one currency that you need to do business in the world. So it needs to be truly global. It needs to function as a medium of exchange for trade and investment. And it needs to be accepted and used by citizens in every sovereign nation.
According to crypto enthusiasts, Bitcoin meets -- at least on paper -- the required characteristics to be the world's reserve currency. In fact, for more than a decade, Bitcoin bulls have made the argument that Bitcoin would eventually replace the U.S. dollar. They view Bitcoin as ""sound money,"" while fiat currencies are fundamentally flawed, due to the ability of governments to print vast sums of money.
At some point in time, the thinking goes, people will prefer to hold Bitcoin rather than dollars. Sovereign governments and central banks will choose to stockpile Bitcoin rather than dollars. Assets will begin to be priced in Bitcoin, rather than in dollars, to facilitate global trade. Eventually, the dollar will become just like the pound, which served as the world's reserve currency for more than a century.
That's all you need to understand the context of Fink's annual letter to investors. As Fink points out in his 2025 letter: ""The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world's reserve currency for decades. But that's not guaranteed to last forever."" He points specifically to the nation's growing debt load, which has grown at 3 times the pace of gross domestic product (GDP) since 1989. In 2025, says Fink, interest payments on that debt will reach nearly $1 trillion, which is more than the U.S. spends on defense.
At some point, it's just not sustainable. The expanding U.S. debt load is a potential house of cards, the unfortunate outcome of America living beyond its means for decades. This is a point that Fink drives home: ""If the U.S. doesn't get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.""
In many ways, what is happening now in America is similar to what happened to Great Britain in the last century. Paying for two world wars at the start of the 20th century nearly bankrupted Great Britain, eventually forcing it to cede its place in the global economy to the United States.
It's hard to imagine a world where Bitcoin takes over immediately. As in the case of the dollar replacing the pound, it will take massive international cooperation. In 1944, it took the Bretton Woods Agreement to make it happen, when dozens of nations from around the world met in New Hampshire to hammer out a deal. In addition to holding gold, the nations agreed to hold dollars, which were backed by the world's largest gold supply at the time. And they agreed on the role of central banks in setting exchange rates pegged to the dollar.
A similar type of massive global cooperation involving Bitcoin might strike some people as being preposterous. But just look at what is happening now with tariffs and a potential trade war with China. Any time the White House says something like ""50 nations called us to discuss a deal,"" I think about a new Bretton Woods.
The current debate over tariffs and trade is exposing all the interdependencies between fiscal deficits, trade deficits, and global economic growth. We're learning about the fragility of the equity and debt markets, and how investor perceptions can change on a dime. The past few weeks have been a crash course in macroeconomics for many investors.
Against this backdrop, sovereign governments and central banks are starting to stockpile Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading the way with its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Russia and China are already experimenting with Bitcoin as a mechanism for international trade, especially in settling energy trades. Bolivia has said it will pay for imported electricity with cryptocurrency, and El Salvador has experimented with Bitcoin-denominated sovereign debt.
These are potential baby steps to Bitcoin eventually replacing the U.S. dollar one day. But it will likely require something massive and consequential, like the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, to make it happen. You can't just say that Bitcoin is a reserve currency and expect it to happen overnight. However, a potential change in the global financial system might be the best reason yet to start buying Bitcoin now.

"Is Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?",ADI ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

"Intel (INTC) Reboots AI Strategy, Eyes Foundry Expansion for NVIDIA",INTC ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) markets key technologies for smart devices. The company has undergone a major restructuring in the past few months. It recently received about $1.9 billion following the completion of a sale of its NAND memory technology and manufacturing business to the South Korean tech giant SK hynix. Lip-Bu Tan, the new CEO of the chip giant, is reportedly considering a revamp of the company’s approach to AI and job cuts. One of the potential changes is a change to the manufacturing operations of the firm to make semiconductors for AI giants like NVIDIA. The Intel foundry already makes chips for other AI giants like Microsoft and Amazon but Tan intends to target new customers. The firm is also looking to expand in areas like software, robotics and AI foundation models.
Overall, INTC ranks 18th on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of these AI companies, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Is Roblox Corporation (RBLX) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,RBLX ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.
To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.

As per Straits Research, the US semiconductor manufacturing equipment market size was pegged at US$13.2 billion in 2024. It is expected to grow from US$13.5 billion in 2025 to US$16.5 billion by 2033. This growth is expected to stem from increasing investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the higher demand for advanced semiconductors in critical sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and EVs.
Straits Research highlighted that the resurgence of semiconductor manufacturing in the US is aided by the government initiatives. The federal push is targeted at reducing the dependency on Asian imports as well as strengthening the domestic supply chains. Leading companies continue to establish new fabs in the US, which helps create demand for advanced wafer manufacturing and fabrication equipment. Overall, the increased requirement for high-performance chips in sectors including defense, telecommunications, and automotive further cements the growth of semiconductor equipment.

Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is engaged in designing, manufacturing, marketing, refurbishing, and servicing semiconductor processing equipment utilized in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Oppenheimer initiated the coverage of the company’s shares with an “Outperform” rating and a price objective of $95. The firm cited Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s dominant position in etch technology and growth potential from NAND upgrades and AI-related demand. The company remains well-placed to benefit as NAND enters a large upgrade cycle, while DRAM remains a bottleneck for the AI compute.
Elsewhere, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated an “Overweight” rating and the price objective of $100, lauding Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s strategy to enhance its share in the wafer fabrication equipment market. As per Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), higher demands on chip performance play into its strengths, with advanced deposition and etch applications well-placed to comprise a growing share of WFE. Vltava Fund, an investment management company, published its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“In the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX). Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact.
Overall,LRCX ranks 8th on our list of best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Accenture plc (ACN): Among the Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in?,ACN ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)’s cash position has remained strong, which has been supporting its dividend payments.

It reported that the area under organic management reached around 96.4 million hectares by the end of 2022, reflecting a significant 26.6% growth compared to the previous year.

Is VICI Properties Inc. (VICI) Among the Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?,VICI ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.
Golf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.
The golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.
According to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.
Finally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum.
Marc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:
“The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.”
The exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.
Technology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf’s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show’s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success.

VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust with one of the largest portfolios of market-leading gaming, hospitality, and entertainment destinations. It has 33 acres of undeveloped and underdeveloped land next to the Las Vegas Strip, as well as four championship golf courses.
The firm uses a net lease model, which means tenants are responsible for the majority of property-related costs. Both parties benefit from this. VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) lowers its costs and reduces the risks related to growing operating costs, and its casino tenants keep operational authority over important business assets.
The company disclosed its Q4 2024 earnings, which showed that its revenues of $976 million were 4.7% higher than the same period the previous year, making it one of the Best Golf Stocks on our list. Earnings per share dropped 19.2% to $0.58, while net income available to common stockholders plummeted 17.8% year on year to $614.6 million. Changes in the CECL allowance for the quarter ending December 31, 2024, were the primary source of this reduction. Furthermore, VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) established a new collaboration with Indigenous Gaming Partners following the latter’s acquisition of PURE Canadian Gaming’s operational assets. The transaction also included an amendment to the present master lease for these sites.
Overall, VICI ranks 10th on our list of the 10 best golf stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of golf companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

“Ugly Read from Verizon!” – Jim Cramer Slams the Telecom Giant Verizon Communications (VZ),VZ ,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.
“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”

Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said
“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”
Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.
“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’
For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offers communication, technology, and entertainment services to consumers, businesses, and government clients. Its services include wireless, broadband, and wireline options. During yesterday’s episode of Mad Money, Cramer said, “Utility, Verizon, perfect Coca-Cola, Waste Management. Yeah, these are timeless.”
Over the past year, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock gained a modest 8.95%. In March, Cramer stated, “We got a real ugly read about the state of telecommunications today from Verizon, the stock fell 6.5% 3 points, wow.”
Furthermore, on April 11, Evercore ISI raised its rating on Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to Outperform from In Line and increased the price target to $48 from $44. The firm noted that although the company has outpaced the broader market this year, it still trails behind AT&T and T-Mobile after years of underperformance.
The analyst pointed to solid progress in postpaid subscriber trends in Consumer, steady growth in Business wireless, and consistent broadband subscriber results. Evercore sees the market overlooking the strength of Verizon’s (NYSE:VZ) wireless revenue outlook, fiber expansion, and the potential benefit from the Frontier acquisition. Verizon is now its top pick in the wireless space and its top value idea.
Overall, VZ ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

"Is ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) the Best Stock for 15 Years?",NOW ,"We recently published a list of Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 15 Best Stocks for 15 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other best stocks for 15 years.
Russell Investments believes that 3 features are defining the market outlook for 2025. These include the elevated level of the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio, the potential for further US dollar strength, as well as the direction of the US 10-year Treasury yield. The active equity managers have been challenged by the severe market concentration. The firm opines that a flattening out of such trends— which can be seen due to policy shifts or change in sentiments related to earnings growth and valuations for mega caps — can support active manager outperformance.
Russell Investments remains focused on sectors in which AI adoption has been ramping up, including industrials, healthcare, and consumer goods. As per the firm, companies that leverage AI for productivity improvements remain well-placed to gain a lasting competitive edge and provide healthy returns. Therefore, skilled active managers are required to look for such companies, primarily those that are in less-covered segments of the market.

With respect to real assets, Russell Investments sees attractive investment opportunities in real estate and infrastructure, mainly sectors that can benefit from the stabilization of long-term interest rates and favorable relative valuations in comparison to other growth assets. The application of AI in real estate, like data centers and healthcare facilities, continues to emerge as a critical growth area. Furthermore, the infrastructure investments continue to gain momentum from energy utilities and pipeline exposures, given the US administration’s emphasis on expanding LNG (liquified natural gas) production.
The firm also believes that an early focus on deregulation and tax cuts would likely be well-received by equity investors. Overall, an expected US soft landing, together with anticipated policy moderation on trade and immigration, creates specific opportunities for well-positioned portfolios, says Russell Investments.

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is engaged in providing manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor, display, and associated industries. Jefferies analysts upped the company’s stock to “Buy” from “Hold” with a price objective of $195, up from the previous target of $185.

“In the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact.
Overall, AMAT ranks 9th on our list of best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

"Is Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP) the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?",ROP ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Roper Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROP) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

For this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Information Technology index, which tracks the performance of major tech companies. From there, we identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders and picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54
Roper Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROP) is a Florida-based broadly diversified technology firm that manages a portfolio of 28 businesses, each of which leads within its specific niche. These businesses are organized under three main segments: application software, network software, and technology-enabled products.
Although Roper Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROP) is clearly recognized as a tech company today, it didn’t start out that way. In its early years, the company was rooted in the industrial sector, producing items like home appliances, pumps, and other industrial equipment. Over the past two decades, the company has steadily moved away from its capital-heavy and cyclical industrial operations by selling off most of those businesses. Today, its focus is on acquiring high-margin, asset-light technology and software firms that generate steady, recurring revenue.
Roper Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROP) posted solid results for the fourth quarter of 2025, with revenue reaching $1.88 billion, which showed a 16.3% increase compared to the same period a year earlier. Adjusted net earnings rose 10% to $520 million. As part of its strategic growth plan, the company invested $3.6 billion in acquiring top-tier vertical software firms. Among the notable additions were Procare Solutions, a key player in early childhood education software, and Transact Campus, which was successfully merged with the CBORD division focused on education and healthcare software.
On March 7, Roper Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROP) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.825 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 33 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock supports a dividend yield of 0.60%, as of April 10.
Overall, ROP ranks 12th on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of ROP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than ROP but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

Why Sky Quarry Inc. (SKYQ) Stock is Gaining This Week,SKYQ ,"We recently compiled a list of the Energy Stocks that are Gaining This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sky Quarry Inc. (NASDAQ:SKYQ) stands against the other energy stocks.
The energy industry has found itself right in the crosshairs of President Trump’s tariff war, sliding more than 8% over the last five days, against a decline of just around 0.5% by the wider market. The global price of crude oil has plummeted by around 22% since the beginning of the year, with the WTI price currently hovering around the $60 mark. The primary reasons for this decline are the escalating US-China trade war, the high prospects of a global economic slowdown, and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May. The Trump administration has indicated a strong preference for reducing crude prices to $50 or lower, but whether this is actually possible remains to be seen, considering that the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
One sector that has garnered special attention from the White House is that of coal. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that aim to boost coal production, while another order asked the US Attorney General to identify state climate laws that stand in the way of developing energy resources like coal and try to stop them from being enforced. Following the President’s orders, the US Energy Department made $200 billion in financing available for its loan programs office including for new coal technologies. However, the orders have raised serious environmental concerns since coal is among the dirtiest fuels available to generate energy. It also remains to be seen whether there is any actual demand for increased coal output, since hundreds of coal-burning plants have already been shut down over the last decade.

To collect data for this article, we have referred to several stock screeners to find energy stocks that have surged the most between April 3 and April 10, 2025. Following are the Energy Stocks that Gained the Most This Week. The stocks are ranked according to their share price surge during this period.

Share Price Gains Between Apr. 3 – Apr. 10: 12.29%
Sky Quarry Inc. (NASDAQ:SKYQ) is an integrated energy solutions company, created to address the environmental issues caused by the landfill disposal of waste asphalt roofing shingles.
Sky Quarry Inc. (NASDAQ:SKYQ) recently revealed some significant milestones it has achieved, including the successful completion of its 2024 capital expenditure program for its flagship hydrocarbon extraction site, PR Spring, and the recent refurbishment of its Foreland Refinery in anticipation of increased capacity in 2025. Moreover, the company announced that it has signed a non-binding LOI with Southwest RAS to explore a strategic collaboration aimed at advancing asphalt shingle recycling in the state of Illinois. SKYQ estimates that the region produces approximately 1.2 million tons of asphalt shingle waste annually, which, if fully recycled, could yield the equivalent of 1.5 million barrels of oil.
Overall, SKYQ ranks 3rd on our list of the energy stocks that gained the most this week. While we acknowledge the potential of energy companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,GOOG ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.

"“Yeah, These Are Timeless.” – Jim Cramer Calls Waste Management, Inc. (WM) a Forever Stock",WM ,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.
“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”

Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said
“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”
Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.
“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’

Diamond Hill Capital stated the following regarding Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“As valuations have continued rising and the economic cycle has gotten relatively long in the tooth, we’ve thought carefully about where and how we are exposed to more cyclical stocks.

"Micron (MU) Hits Record HBM Revenue, Guides $8.8B for Fiscal Q3",MU ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

Despite concerns surrounding the tariff situation, the company delivered impressive revenue numbers in the latest earnings report. The firm achieved record revenue in data center DRAM during fiscal Q2, with HBM revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. The company credited the strong product momentum and leadership in low-power DRAM for the data center as key drivers. The company plans further growth in DRAM and NAND bit shipments in fiscal Q3, with revenue forecasted at $8.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million, with a gross margin of 36.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. Operating expenses are projected at approximately $1.13 billion. Fiscal Q3 EPS is expected to be $1.57 per share, plus or minus $0.10.

Is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) the Best Medical Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,UNH ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.
Some experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country’s entire national output.
Holz said that the country’s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long.

Holz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector.
It is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it’s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven.
In this article, we first sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list of stocks. We then examined Insider Monkey’s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 best medical stocks with the most billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.

UnitedHealth Group also owns Optum, which is a rapidly growing healthcare services company. The environment for the health insurance business remains positive as growth in healthcare spending, driven by chronic diseases and an aging population, will continue to outpace overall economic growth. The insurance business benefits from powerful network effects as more members attract more providers and vice versa, which reinforces United’s value proposition and bargaining power with each side of the network. We respect UnitedHealth Group’s management team and have been very pleased with their long-term vision and execution.”

Vertiv (VRT) Raises 2025 Sales Target as AI Powers 77% EPS Surge,VRT ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

"Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW): AI Cybersecurity Giant Eyes $700 Million Protect AI Acquisition",PANW ,"We recently published a list of 14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention.
In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution.
OpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology.
Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity.
OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion.

“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,”
In response, Musk’s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI.
“Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It’s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI’s assets allegedly ‘interferes’ with their business plans.”

Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is a leader in AI-powered cybersecurity. On April 10, HSBC upgraded the stock to “Hold” from “Reduce” with a price target of $156.00. The rating upgrade follows resilient cybersecurity demand amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a reasonable valuation.
The firm considers cybersecurity to be “recession resilient,” explaining that spending on security most likely holds up even during economic slowdowns. The analyst wrote that past evidence is indicative of how revenue growth at key cybersecurity firms remains immaterially impacted by economic growth changes.
In other news, a report by Globes has revealed that Palo Alto is eyeing Protect AI, a Seattle-based startup offering AI scanning, large language model security, and generative AI red teaming, for acquisition. The report noted that Palo Alto may acquire ProtectAI for around $650 million to $700 million.

"Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Is a Top 10 Tech Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher",META ,"We recently published a list of Top 12 Tech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.
Under the umbrella of Fisher Asset Management, Billionaire Ken Fisher has maintained a positive stance on technology stocks, particularly those within the “Magnificent Seven.” While emphasizing the strong performance of these large-cap growth companies, Fisher emphasizes that the ongoing bull market extends beyond just these high-profile names. According to him, the 2024 rally has been broader than it is generally perceived, with growth stocks, especially in tech and communication services, consistently outperforming their value and small-cap counterparts.
Ken Fisher’s discussion revealed a notable trend: tech stocks have tended to outperform during market upswings and underperform during downturns. This pattern, evident throughout the statistics of 2024, strengthens the theory that if investors believe in a continuing bull market, technology stocks will likely remain strong performers. Although they may not always lead the market consistently or across every metric, according to historical evidence, their overall performance consistently outshines most other sectors and groupings.
Fisher’s perspective suggested that while technology stocks may not dominate the market indefinitely, their performance still serves as a bellwether for broader market sentiment. He stated that investing in these companies is not about expecting perfection but recognizing that in bullish environments, they tend to deliver higher returns. At the same time, he warned against focusing too narrowly on these names, as the broader growth category spanning across sectors is also poised to benefit from favorable market conditions.
In summary, Fisher Asset Management’s investment approach shows confidence in the long-term prospects of technology stocks. Though Ken Fisher concedes there are no certainties in the market, he points to a clear directional relationship: when the market rises, these stocks tend to rise more; when it falls, they decline more. For Fisher, this reinforces the strategic value of maintaining strong exposure to tech-driven growth stocks in a bullish environment.
We searched through Fisher Asset Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify the top tech stocks that the firm is invested in. From the resultant data, we ranked the technology equities based on his hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Additionally, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The parent company of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered strong financial performance in 2024, with total revenue reaching $164.5 billion, growing 22% year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by the strength of its family of apps, contributing $162.4 billion of the total revenue, up from $133 billion the previous year. The company reported a total profit of $62.4 billion, marking a 59% year-over-year increase. Meta’s workforce expanded by 10% in 2024, ending the year with 74,067 employees, reflecting its ongoing strategic growth and investment in innovation.
The fourth quarter alone accounted for 29.4% of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s annual revenue, generating $48.4 billion in revenue and over $20.8 billion in profit for the period. Meta’s strong Q4 performance included a 21% year-over-year revenue increase, surpassing analyst expectations, while earnings per share (EPS) rose by 50% to $8.02, surpassing the forecasted $6.76. Despite the company’s impressive financial metrics, its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality technologies, recorded an operating loss of $5 billion on revenue of nearly $1.1 billion. The company’s expanding influence on emerging technologies, particularly AI integration across its platforms, positions it as a continued leader in the tech sector.
By the end of Q4 2024, 262 hedge funds held stakes in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), up from 235 in the previous quarter. Hedge fund holdings in the company surged to approximately $59.4 billion, according to Insider Monkey’s database. This increase reflects investor belief in Meta’s strategic vision and its ability to deliver long-term shareholder value through sustained innovation, robust earnings growth, and a dominant presence in digital advertising.
With over 6.6 million shares reported in its 13F holding, Ken Fisher holds a stake of approximately $3.90 billion in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), making it tenth on the list of top tech stocks to buy according to the billionaire.
Rowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): Investment Initiated: April 2018: Internal Rate of Return (IRR*): 22% *IRR represents the annualized rate of return on an investment, accounting for the timing and magnitude of cash flows over the holding period.

Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE) develops solid-oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation, helping meet the growing energy demands of AI data centers. On April 11, TD Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne maintained a “Hold” rating on the stock and set a price target of $20.00. The firm discussed how it expects a positive outlook from the company, but pointed out project completion timings to be a challenge. Bloom’s pipeline, particularly a significant portion of its AEP deal, is facing uncertainties due to legislative impacts in Ohio as well as the timing of larger data center projects.
Back in November, the company signed a supply agreement with American Electric Power (AEP) for up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of its products. The initial installation of Bloom’s fuel cells was set to meet the immediate power needs of AI data centers. Besides the pipeline uncertainty, there is reduced transparency regarding MW/ASP disclosures and concerns over margins stemming from increased costs of larger data center projects. Like many other companies, Bloom Energy is also subject to uncertainties coming from tariffs. All of these factors have collectively led to a Hold rating toward the stock.

Is Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) the Safest Dividend Stock to Buy Now?,PEG ,"We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) stands against other safest dividend stocks to buy now.
Today, in this article, we will be looking at the 10 safest dividend stocks you might be interested in adding to your portfolio.
The stock market has become increasingly volatile, constantly causing investors to look for stability. But few instruments offer stability as much as dividend-paying stocks.

With fresh trade tensions arising from unprecedented policy revisions from Washington, price appreciation alone may not be a dependable strategy for investors. Income-focused portfolios are becoming more than just a hedge. They are a necessity.
President Trump made a recent announcement, an update to the new tariff policies, whereby a whopping 145% rate is slapped on Chinese imports while maintaining a 10% baseline for other countries for 90 days. Negotiations are expected between the U.S. and other countries during this period, which, if they do not go well, will bring back the reciprocal tariffs originally announced on April 2, 2025. The announcement sent ripples once again across the global trade. All the major indices are struggling to find equilibrium in the middle of the uncertainty. The situation further raises the importance of stabilized equities that could remain immune to the market whiplash up to some level.
In this regard, safe dividend stocks provide income without compromising their defensiveness – qualities that are becoming harder to ignore in today’s time. Investments in dividend stocks are not just about cushioning against losses but also about long-term compounding and shareholder rewards. Investors prioritize dividends for the sake of sustainable yield that builds wealth gradually. Companies with strong dividend track records have historically stood against worse market conditions more effectively than their non-dividend counterparts. These stocks have safely harbored elevated capital inflow at times of increased volatility, indicating their trust in the broader market.
Recent market turmoil sees value-based investments in dividend-yielding equities becoming a compelling alternative to growth stocks investing among institutional players. Multiple strategists covered by CNBC noted portfolio managers pulling their investments from speculative names and diverting into more fundamentally grounded positions to overcome the unpredictable policy actions and inflation volatility.
But which dividend stocks to pick? Investors are facing not only economic cycles in today’s market environment but also political cycles. Trade, taxation, and regulation are politicized so that the markets are exposed to a profoundly impactful risk that cannot be quantified. It calls for a revisal of a portfolio that includes equities rooted in strong fundamentals and offers high yields.
With this in mind, our article will explore the 10 safest stocks investors could buy now to add resilience to their portfolios. Our curated selection is designed to offer consistent payouts and protect capital from the tremors induced by policies today. You might want to safeguard your capital, generate passive income, or just sleep better at night. Our picks in this article offer you all these in a market that is anything but predictable.
When assembling our list, we followed a few criteria to optimize our picks for the investors. Primarily, we included those stocks with a minimum market cap of $2 billion to ensure the financial soundness of the companies. We also aimed for those stocks that have outperformed the benchmark, so we excluded those below the 52-week market performance of 3%.
Since we want our article to benefit income-seeking investors, we placed a dividend yield limit of a minimum of 2%. Above all, we included only those stocks with a beta of 0.5 or less. A higher beta suggests higher volatility in market events, which increases the potential risks. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 11, 2025. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield. We have also looked into the hedge fund backing the stock to estimate the institutional interests.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Having reached a net income of $3.54 per share in 2024, the company achieved the high end of its non-GAAP operating earnings guidance range of $3.68 per share.  For the 14th consecutive year, the Board of Directors has announced an increase of $0.12 per share of the annual common dividend.  Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) also gained approval to invest $2.9 billion in its Clean Energy Future Energy Efficiency 2 program. The program is expected to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, leading to the company’s value growth in 2025.
The restrained beta of 0.49 reflects Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG)’s strong market insulation. A dividend yield of 2.99% ensures income continuity, while the strong institutional interest, represented by 42 hedge funds, indicates the underappreciated potential of the company as one of the safest stocks to buy.
Overall, PEG ranks 5th on our list of safest dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of PEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than PEG but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

"Vistra (VST) Upgraded by BofA as Power Demand, AI Needs Surge",VST ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) operates as an integrated retail electricity and power generation company. In early March, following strong quarterly results, Bank of America upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral with a $152 price target. In an investor note, analyst Ross Fowler viewed Vistra’s base business of baseload generation and competitive retail as well-positioned to benefit from tightening markets in PJM and ERCOT, increasing demand and retail growth, regardless of datacenter deals. For 2026, the company has maintained confidence in adjusted EBITDA exceeding $6 billion. However, CEO Burke has noted that legislative and regulatory uncertainties in Texas and PJM markets could impact future investments and timelines, particularly for new-generation projects.
Overall, VST ranks 7th on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of these AI companies, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The Companies and Markets Hit Hardest by Trump’s Tariffs,^GSPC ,"President Trump’s sweeping tariff plans kicked off a historically volatile 10 days in markets.
Stock indexes plunged, bonds sold off at the fastest rate in decades, and the dollar fell rapidly against the euro and yen. Wall Street leaders are sounding the alarm on a recession.

With the U.S. stock market adding and erasing trillions of dollars in value by the day, here is where things stand heading into the third week of trading since Trump escalated a global trade war:
Equities cratered in the two trading days after broad tariffs were announced, with the S&P 500 posting back-to-back declines of more than 4%. Trading has been choppy ever since, with measures of volatility for the broad-based index at the highest level since the pandemic shut down the U.S. economy in March 2020.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors are down since the announcement, with energy the hardest hit. That is because oil prices have tumbled to their lowest levels since 2021 on fears that a global recession will curb demand.
The materials and consumer-discretionary sectors are both down sharply because of their reliance on imports, while real estate and financials were hit hard by worries about slowing growth.
The government-bond market has put both investors and the White House on edge.
Longer-dated Treasurys rallied over the first few days of the stock selloff. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, a key reference rate for borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to student loans, dipped below 4%.
It was what investors have come to expect during times of market turmoil and fear—money flowing from stocks to ultrasafe Treasurys—and why many turn to bonds as ballast for their portfolios.
This time, though, the rally ended abruptly. A bond selloff that began Monday turned into the biggest weekly climb in the 10-year yield in almost 25 years, alarming traders.
Concerns that investors had lost confidence and were cutting exposure even to safe U.S. assets played into Trump’s decision to put most of the new tariffs on a 90-day pause on Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported.
After a brief pause, however, yields rose to new recent highs on Friday. And the dollar slid to fresh lows.
Traders are bracing for more big moves ahead. The Cboe Volatility Index, which tracks expectations for the size of stock swings over the next 30 days, just touched the highest level since March 2020.

"Investing $60,000 in These 3 Funds Could Generate Annual Income of Over $6,500",BLK ,"Income investors could pay attention to the price fluctuations of the assets they own. But they don't have to. What really matters for them is that the dividends and distributions keep flowing steadily -- and the higher the yield, the better.
Where can you find great candidates to achieve these objectives? Investing $60,000 in these three closed-end funds (CEFs) could generate an annual income of over $6,500.
The BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund (NYSE: DSU), which is managed by giant investment company BlackRock, boasts a lofty distribution rate of 12%. If you invested $20,000 (one-third of your initial $60,000) in this CEF, your annual income would total $2,400 at that rate.
This CEF invests primarily in secured and unsecured U.S. corporate loans. Its portfolio includes 1,253 holdings. None comprise more than 3% of total assets, with most holdings below 1%.
Why should income investors like the BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund (aside from its juicy yield)? For one thing, Morningstar gives it a five-star rating (the highest score possible) based on its risk-adjusted total return. The CEF pays a monthly distribution and is trading at a discount of more than 3% below its net asset value (NAV).
There are some downsides to the fund, though. It's exposed to some risk if companies default on their loans (although that risk is mitigated somewhat by its highly diversified portfolio). The BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund uses leverage, which increases its risk to sharp interest rate spikes. However, its leverage ratio of 15.43% isn't super high. The CEF also has a gross expense ratio of 2.33%. The good news on that front is that its distribution is net of expenses.
Aberdeen Investments' Abrdn Healthcare Opportunities Fund (NYSE: THQ) currently offers a distribution yield of 11.33%. Buying $20,000 worth of this CEF would generate $2,266 in annual income at that level.
As its name hints, this fund invests in the healthcare sector. It owns 110 holdings, including common stocks, preferred stocks, and debt of healthcare companies. The CEF's top holdings are Eli Lilly, UnitedHealth Group, AbbVie, Abbott Laboratories, and Merck stocks.
The Abrdn Healthcare Opportunities Fund pays its distributions monthly. The CEF is also available at a small discount right now, trading at 0.78% below its NAV. Since healthcare stocks often hold up relatively well in volatile markets, the fund could be an especially good pick in the current environment.
On the negative side, this fund uses more leverage than some investors will prefer, with its leverage ratio of 22%. It also has a high annual expense ratio of 3.1%.
Investing in another CEF managed by BlackRock could also enable income investors to rake in money. The BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund (NYSE: CII) pays a distribution yield of 9.28%. Buying $20,000 of this fund would give you $1,856 in annual income at that rate, bringing our total income for these three CEFs to $6,522.
This CEF owns 222 large-cap stocks, of which nearly 95% are based in the U.S. Its top holdings include Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Visa, and Cardinal Health. The fund also sells call and put options to boost income and reduce portfolio volatility.
Morningstar gave the BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund four out of five stars. Like the other two CEFs on our list, it pays distributions monthly. The fund's annual expense ratio of 0.93% is relatively low for CEFs. You can also buy the fund at a discount of roughly 7% below its NAV.
The main drawback to owning the BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund is that its price can decline significantly at times (such as during the recent market sell-off). However, the fund's options strategy provides a cushion to some extent.
Before you buy stock in BlackRock Enhanced Large Cap Core Fund, consider this:

In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) stands against other best organic food stocks to buy according to billionaires.
According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the organic food and beverages market has a size of $184.87 billion as of 2025. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.02% between 2025 and 2030, reaching $247.63 billion at the end of the forecast period. At present, North America is the largest market for the sector. However, Asia Pacific takes the lead as the fastest growing.
The primary cause behind the growth of the global organic food and beverage market is the increasing adoption of natural and healthy food and beverage options by consumers. Consumers are exhibiting growing inclination and awareness towards the health benefits of organic food products, which is continually acting as the primary stimulus for this industry.

Published by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and IFOAM—Organics International, the 25th edition of the yearbook “The World of Organic Agriculture” shows that the organic farming sector is undergoing significant growth and expansion. It reported that the area under organic management reached around 96.4 million hectares by the end of 2022, reflecting a significant 26.6% growth compared to the previous year. This translates to an expansion of 20.3 million hectares.
The report also showed that the United States took the lead as the largest market in the sector, valued at around EUR 56.6 billion in 2022. Germany followed close behind at EUR 15.3 billion, while China took the third spot at EUR 12.4 billion. The United States and Canada underwent growth in retail sales in the sector, reflecting increases of 4.4% and 9.7%, respectively. These trends show that consumers are increasingly showing interest in organic products, and health consciousness and awareness are supporting demand in North America.
However, these trends are not concentrated in North America alone. The report showed that expansion in organic farming areas occurred across all continents, bringing to life a global trend towards organic food intake and sustainable agricultural practices. The number of organic farmers also rose globally, increasing to 4.5 million in 2022 and reflecting an approximately 26% rise from 2021.

As per Straits Research, the US semiconductor manufacturing equipment market size was pegged at US$13.2 billion in 2024. It is expected to grow from US$13.5 billion in 2025 to US$16.5 billion by 2033. This growth is expected to stem from increasing investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the higher demand for advanced semiconductors in critical sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and EVs.
Straits Research highlighted that the resurgence of semiconductor manufacturing in the US is aided by the government initiatives. The federal push is targeted at reducing the dependency on Asian imports as well as strengthening the domestic supply chains.

Overall, the increased requirement for high-performance chips in sectors including defense, telecommunications, and automotive further cements the growth of semiconductor equipment.

"Like it or not, the bond market rules all",^GSPC ,"President Trump unveiled his grand tariff strategy in the late afternoon on April 2, probably expecting the stock market to hate the plan. And it did. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 597 points, or 10.5%, over the next two days.
To put the debacle into perspective, the S&P 500's beatdown was its biggest two-day point loss since the end of 2007, bigger even than the 2-day loss the index suffered as the Covid-19 pandemic erupted in 2020.
💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰
While many Americans may have been reeling from the magnitude of the stock market's decline, something else was going on. The bond market was reacting, too, only a little later.
The 10-year Treasury yield, after falling in tandem with stocks on April 3 and April 4, started to move higher. From 4.009% on Friday, the yield rose to 4.177% on Monday. Then, to 4.304% on Tuesday. Early Wednesday, the yield had jumped above 4.5%, a jump so dramatic even the president had to take notice.
Related: Tariffs could lead to major nightmare for U.S. tech stocks
The bond market, he told reporters Wednesday morning, had become a little ""yippy."" That's a golfing term used to describe a player too nervous to putt effectively.
As a result, he had to decided to suspend for 90 days most of the tariffs imposed only a week before, and stocks soared in a monstrous relief rally on Wednesday and in a second rally on Friday.
But the 10-year yield kept rising anyway. It reached nearly 4.6% before closing at 4.5% on Friday. The 10-year note's close was its highest since February. It pushed up one measure of 30-year mortgage rates — from Mortgage News Daily — 7.1% from 6.6% a week earlier.
Which translates into this: The monthly principal and interest payment on a $250,000, 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose from $1,597 to $1,675, a 4.9% increase.
So, yes, stocks recovered by Friday (though still way off from their all-time highs), but bond yields did, too. So, the story may not be over yet. We'll see how markets react next week and over the next 90 days. (Bitcoin was up 11% between its Tuesday low and its Saturday close.)
The trade fight between the United States and China has become extremely intense.
The overall trade controversy was muted a bit by the Trump Administration's move late Friday to exempt the worst of the tariffs on smart phones, computers, semiconductors and related products made or assembled in China.
Apple  (AAPL)  was relieved. It assembles most of its iPhones in China. Apple jumped 4.1% on Friday. Nvidia  (NVDA)  was up 3.1%.
The United States has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods. China has responded with 125% tariffs on imports from the U.S.

Still, everyone should pay attention because, when it comes to the price of money, the bond market rules all. As this past week or so clearly showed, the bond world was not impressed.
Normally, bond brokers and investors don't make a lot of noise. Underwriters sell bonds for clients to investors, often pension funds, insurance companies, and others.
Each side has its motivations:
The investors want to put cash to work in a conservative, stable predictable way because they have obligations to meet, like paying dividends, pensions to pensioners or having reserves sufficient enough to pay off insurance claims, maintaining reserves for emergencies.
The clients can be governments, banks, companies, state and local agencies, hospitals, school districts, colleges and universities, hospitals and the like who need capital to grow, add new factories, build bridges, highways, schools or hospital additions.
Over the term of the bond, the clients pay a specific rate of return, usually twice yearly. At the end of the term, the clients repay or refinance the face amount of the each bond.
This is a huge business, larger than the stock market. The global bond market was worth $140.7 trillion at the end of 2023, compared to the $115 trillion global equity market, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).
It is a critical piece of any economy. The New York Canal, a 41-mile irrigation canal that's been bringing water to southwest Idaho farmers since its 1909 opening, got its name from the New York investors who contributed early capital for its development.
The Trump tariff plan did not seem especially well thought out. Legions of conservatives, even The Wall Street Journal, joined liberals in panning it publicly.
Stocks crashed and then the bond market reacted by selling U.S. treasuries, pushing yields higher.
Can one say who has been doing the selling?

No, the business is run by people who want to be discrete. But the selling has been unmistakable. More than ""yippy?"" (To use the president's phrase.) Maybe.
And there's motivation because what made the U.S. exceptional in growth, innovation, and opportunity has faded, Wall Street Journal columnist Greg Ip wrote this week. ""The U.S. is still exceptional,  but it is also less predictable, more antagonistic, and more isolated. For foreign investors, that makes it less safe.""

This may prove the great weapon against the Trump plan. Non-U.S. investors own $8.5 trillion in treasury securities, led by:
Japan, the leading holder with $1 trillion alone.
China with $760.8 billion.
The United Kingdom with $740.2 billion.
All they have to do is start selling more aggressively, and yields will jump, causing all sorts of havoc in the U.S. Treasury market.
There's another market that's vulnerable: the mortgage market. Lenders make loans to home owners, using capital raised by selling bonds specifically earmarked for housing.
A Diana Olick report on CNBC broadcast Friday noted there are $1.32 trillion in mortgage securities outstanding. About 15% are held by foreign investors. The biggest holders: Japan, China, Taiwan and Canada.
Both Japan and China have been reducing their holdings. If they decided to dump the positions, the effect on the mortgage market could be considerable.

Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE): Among Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Top Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential,RARE ,"We recently published a list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Top 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE) stands against other Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s top stock picks with huge upside potential.
Wall Street is overflowing with data. If companies are not releasing their earnings, economic data flows almost daily. This abundance of data can be overwhelming, making it easy to miss important signals. That’s why investors monitor billionaires who’ve made and continue to make their fortunes on Wall Street. The list of these billionaires is long, but a few, such as Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller, stand out.
Druckenmiller is a former Soros protégé who, after 12 years at Soros Fund Management, opted to exit and focus fully on his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital, in 2000. He later transitioned this outfit into a family office – Duquesne Family Office – in 2010. Over the past eight quarters (up to Q4 2024), the family office has consistently outperformed the S&P 500. The top 20 holdings weighted have returned 81.63% in three years (cumulatively) and 22.01% (annualized).

This billionaire is widely respected across Wall Street for many things, but most of all, his market acumen, integrity, and agility. One should recall that he was part of the Soros Fund Management crew that shorted the British pound in the early 1990s to the point of almost breaking the Bank of England. His genius in the market has been noticed by many. Ken Langone, another billionaire, described Druckenmiller as the best investor he’s ever known.
Druckenmiller is also influential. The Financial Times reports that the veteran investor could significantly influence the direction of the current US government economic policies. Scott Bessent, the current Treasury secretary, and Kevin Warsh, a possible successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, are Druckenmiller’s proteges. According to the FT, these three “have a great relationship”, which implies that Druckenmiller has a direct line to the country’s most crucial economic thinkers.
Druckenmiller’s investing strategy is to chase value over hype. In other words, the 71-year-old billionaire focuses on investing in undervalued stocks rather than jumping on trendy ones. Simply put, he prefers solid opportunities over flashy ones. Just recently, he exited two of the most high-profile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. This is an eye-brow-raising move, but if the billionaire’s genius is anything to go by, there must be value he is chasing.
To compile this list, we reviewed the Duquesne Family Office’s SEC Q4 2024 13F filings. We picked 10 stocks that have the highest upside potential from their current levels based on average analyst price targets (as of April 11). Finally, we organized the stocks in ascending order based on their highest analyst upside potential while also outlining hedge fund sentiment regarding these stocks as of Q4 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE) is another biopharmaceutical company in Druckenmiller’s portfolio. It develops treatments for rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases, which often have no approved therapies. The leading products include approved treatments like Burosumab (for a bone disorder called XLH), Triheptanoin (for certain metabolic disorders), and Vestronidase alfa (for a rare enzyme deficiency).
In Q4 2024, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE) reported strong financial results, with total revenue of $560 million, exceeding previous guidance. For 2025, the company projects continued growth with total revenue between $640 million to $670 million.
In light of this performance, CEO Emil D. Kakkis believes that they “have created a next-generation rare disease company on a pathway to profitability with meaningful revenue growth from multiple global products.”
The company is approaching several major catalysts in 2025. One of the major ones is a pending FDA decision for Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.’s (NASDAQ:RARE) gene therapy to treat Sanfilippo syndrome, which is expected in the second half of the year. The firm is also planning to submit a biologics license application for its Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia (GSDIa) gene therapy in mid-2025. Additionally, the Phase 3 ORBIT study for setrusumab in osteogenesis imperfecta is progressing toward a second interim analysis in mid-2025. On March 27, JPMorgan raised Ultragenyx’s (NASDAQ:RARE) price target from $104 to $117 and rated the shares as Overweight. It cites a “very favorable” reward/risk profile for the company’s clinical programs.
Overall, RARE ranks 3rd on our list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s top stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of RARE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

"Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 1 ""Magnificent Seven"" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock She Just Couldn't Pass Up During the Nasdaq Sell-Off",NVDA ,"Cathie Wood is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Ark Invest, which offers a small catalog of innovation-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Those funds' portfolios tend to be dominated by smaller, speculative companies in emerging industries.
While these investment preferences may suggest that Wood has an appetite for risk, her funds also hold a number of blue chip stocks -- including one ""Magnificent Seven"" stock she just scooped up more of amid the Nasdaq's sharp sell-off.
Wood has an interesting relationship with semiconductor behemoth Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Although she's held positions the chipmaker for years, she actually has been a seller of the stock more often than a buyer.
Ironically, she dumped nearly all of her Nvidia position around November 2022 -- right around the time ChatGPT was released and artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as the next big megatrend.
Since the start of 2025, Nvidia's stock price has been under a lot of pressure due to a host of factors: China's DeepSeek models, rising competition in the GPU space from Advanced Micro Devices and cloud hyperscalers designing their own custom AI chips, and most recently, macro uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policies.
Now, with Nvidia shares down by 24% from the all-time high they hit just a few months ago, Wood may have a second chance. Between April 7 and 8, her funds purchased roughly 341,000 shares of Nvidia, essentially doubling Ark's stake in it.
From a macro perspective, the secular tailwinds continue to support the growth of the data center industry, and Nvidia remains well positioned to continue capturing a large proportion of the expanding market for AI accelerator chips. Consider what AI's biggest spenders have up their sleeves. Cloud hyperscalers Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft all announced earlier this year that they intend to continue investing heavily in infrastructure to support AI. Meta Platforms expressed a similar outlook during its fourth-quarter earnings call.
On a combined basis, these four Magnificent Seven companies' AI capital expenditures could top $320 billion in 2025 alone. Each is a major customer of Nvidia, so I'm optimistic about its prospects relating to their data center build-outs.
In addition, Nvidia recently released its newest GPU architecture, Blackwell, sales of which have so far outperformed management's expectations. And while the early indicators for Blackwell are encouraging, Nvidia is on track to deliver its successor GPU architecture in a couple of years. This all positions Nvidia well for robust long-term growth as the AI narrative continues to unfold.
Even in the face of encouraging business trends, Nvidia stock has gotten decimated during the ongoing Nasdaq sell-off. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 39. It has only rarely been this low in more than five years.
While Wood's purchases of Nvidia aren't necessarily large compared to her core holdings, I find her decisions to buy the stock on consecutive days this week pretty interesting. Nvidia's underlying business looks solid, and with the stock now trading at a historically cheap valuation, it's just too hard to pass up -- even for a more speculative investor such as Wood.
I think growth investors with long-term time horizons should consider following Wood's lead here and take advantage of Nvidia's slide. The long-term outlooks for the company and the AI narrative in general still look positive. In that context, the current sour sentiment in the stock market looks to have created a potentially lucrative opportunity here for patient investors who can stomach some volatility.
Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

"Why Aemetis, Inc. (AMTX) Stock is Gaining This Week",AMTX ,"We recently compiled a list of the Energy Stocks that are Gaining This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMTX) stands against the other energy stocks.
The energy industry has found itself right in the crosshairs of President Trump’s tariff war, sliding more than 8% over the last five days, against a decline of just around 0.5% by the wider market. The global price of crude oil has plummeted by around 22% since the beginning of the year, with the WTI price currently hovering around the $60 mark. The primary reasons for this decline are the escalating US-China trade war, the high prospects of a global economic slowdown, and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May. The Trump administration has indicated a strong preference for reducing crude prices to $50 or lower, but whether this is actually possible remains to be seen, considering that the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
One sector that has garnered special attention from the White House is that of coal. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that aim to boost coal production, while another order asked the US Attorney General to identify state climate laws that stand in the way of developing energy resources like coal and try to stop them from being enforced. Following the President’s orders, the US Energy Department made $200 billion in financing available for its loan programs office including for new coal technologies. However, the orders have raised serious environmental concerns since coal is among the dirtiest fuels available to generate energy. It also remains to be seen whether there is any actual demand for increased coal output, since hundreds of coal-burning plants have already been shut down over the last decade.

Share Price Gains Between Apr. 3 – Apr. 10: 5.92%
Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMTX) is an advanced renewable fuels and biochemicals company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative technologies.
The stock of Aemetis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMTX) surged after the company announced this week that its production of renewable natural gas (RNG) increased 55% in March compared to the previous month. AMTX also stated that it had completed a sale of LCFS (Low Carbon Fuel Standard) and D3 RINs at the end of the first quarter. Moreover, the company revealed that it is in the final phase of LCFS pathway approvals for seven dairy digesters by the California Air Resources Board CARB, which is expected to be received in Q2 and should generate about $6 million of increased annual revenues.
Overall, AMTX ranks 8th on our list of the energy stocks that gained the most this week. While we acknowledge the potential of energy companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Apple Inc. (AAPL): Analysts See AI-Powered iPhone Supercycle on Horizon Despite Tariff Pressures,AAPL ,"We recently published a list of 14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention.
In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution.
OpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology.
Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity.
OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion.

“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,”
In response, Musk’s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI.
“Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It’s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI’s assets allegedly ‘interferes’ with their business plans.”
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On April 10, Morgan Stanley reiterated the stock as “Overweight”, stating that it is sticking with the stock despite tariff headwinds.
“With the largest base of pent up iPhone demand ever new AI features rolling out (slowly) around the world, and a renewed focus on device form factor changes, we believe Apple can accelerate iPhone growth starting in FY27, before replacement cycles contract in the 2 years thereafter..”
Analysts on Wall Street currently have a consensus “Buy” rating on the stock. The average price target of $250 implies a 26% upside, however, the Street-high target of $308 implies an upside of 55%.
Overall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Is Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM) Among the Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?,COLM ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Columbia Sportswear Company (NASDAQ:COLM) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.
Golf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.
The golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.
According to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.
Finally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum.
Marc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:
“The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.”
The exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.
Technology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership.

Why Centrus Energy Corp. (LEU) Stock is Gaining This Week,LEU ,"We recently compiled a list of the Energy Stocks that are Gaining This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Centrus Energy Corp. (NYSE:LEU) stands against the other energy stocks.
The energy industry has found itself right in the crosshairs of President Trump’s tariff war, sliding more than 8% over the last five days, against a decline of just around 0.5% by the wider market. The global price of crude oil has plummeted by around 22% since the beginning of the year, with the WTI price currently hovering around the $60 mark. The primary reasons for this decline are the escalating US-China trade war, the high prospects of a global economic slowdown, and the recent decision by OPEC+ to increase supply in May. The Trump administration has indicated a strong preference for reducing crude prices to $50 or lower, but whether this is actually possible remains to be seen, considering that the US oil industry needs prices between $61 and $70 per barrel to be profitable, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
One sector that has garnered special attention from the White House is that of coal. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that aim to boost coal production, while another order asked the US Attorney General to identify state climate laws that stand in the way of developing energy resources like coal and try to stop them from being enforced. Following the President’s orders, the US Energy Department made $200 billion in financing available for its loan programs office including for new coal technologies. However, the orders have raised serious environmental concerns since coal is among the dirtiest fuels available to generate energy. It also remains to be seen whether there is any actual demand for increased coal output, since hundreds of coal-burning plants have already been shut down over the last decade.

To collect data for this article, we have referred to several stock screeners to find energy stocks that have surged the most between April 3 and April 10, 2025. Following are the Energy Stocks that Gained the Most This Week. The stocks are ranked according to their share price surge during this period.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Share Price Gains Between Apr. 3 – Apr. 10: 4.63% Centrus Energy Corp. (NYSE:LEU) is a trusted supplier of nuclear fuel and services for the nuclear power industry. Centrus Energy Corp. (NYSE:LEU) is the only American company with proven enrichment technology, giving it a significant advantage in the current global trade war. Moreover, earlier this month, Craig-Hallum initiated coverage of LEU with a Buy rating and $129 price target. As the world goes through a nuclear renaissance, especially during the current AI boom, Centrus Energy’s domestic nuclear fuel solution is vital to national security. The company’s $60 million investment at its Oak Ridge facility will significantly help advance the country’s uranium enrichment capabilities.
Overall, LEU ranks 10th on our list of the energy stocks that gained the most this week. While we acknowledge the potential of energy companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Is Newton Golf Company (NWTG) Among the Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?,NWTG ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Golf Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Newton Golf Company (NASDAQ:NWTG) stands against other best golf stocks to buy according to analysts.
Golf stocks are publicly traded firms that are part of the golf industry. These companies include businesses that manufacture golf equipment, operate golf courses, and provide associated services, giving investors a chance to engage in the golf market.
The golf industry continues to evolve with women, social play, lessons, and online bookings driving key developments. According to a report by NBC Sports Next, female engagement has grown by 15%, with 800,000 more women golfers joining between 2020 and 2022, compared to a 2% rise among male golfers. Women now account for one-third of junior players and 49% of surveyed golfers. Golf remains a strongly social activity, with 49% of surveyed golfers primarily playing with friends. Business-related golf is also growing, notably among GolfNow users. While 36% of golfers took a lesson in the previous year, the number rose to 67% among GolfNow customers, with many preferring a combination of on-course and facility-based training. Moreover, younger golfers are frequently booking online, with 43% of those aged 18 to 34 reserving at least one round by 2023. Speed and convenience are essential, with 55% citing online booking as the quickest option. These developments point out expansion prospects for courses that cater to women, social golfers, and digitally aware players.
According to the National Golf Foundation’s research, the golf business in the United States is still expanding rapidly, with 45 million Americans (aged 6 and up) playing golf in 2023, including 26.6 million on-course and 18.4 million in off-course venues like simulators and Topgolf. The business has seen nearly 2 million new golfers each year for the past ten years, with 3.4 million first-time players projected in 2023 alone. The largest consumer age group is still young adults (18-34 years old), with 6.3 million participants on the course and 5.8 million off. Since 2019, juniors (3.5 million) have shot up by 40%, with girls accounting for 37%. Female involvement has climbed to 7 million, making up 26% of on-course golfers. In 2023, rounds played reached a record high of 531 million, beating the pre-pandemic average by more than 10%. The US offers 16,000 courses at 14,000 facilities, with 75% open to the public. Despite a 12% drop in course supply since 2006, demand remains high, with 22.4 million people expressing a desire to play.
Finally, TGL, the golf league that began playing matches in January 2025, is combining digital and physical components to create an entirely new hybrid golf experience. Teams of golfers compete in a specially created venue across a set of custom-made holes. They begin by hitting a large-screen simulator of real terrain, then shift to a transformable turntable as the green. Broadcasting innovations aimed at bringing golfers’ experiences closer to home viewers were deemed crucial from the start. The 2025 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando showcased the golf industry’s strong momentum.
Marc Simon, Vice President of PGA Golf Exhibitions, stated:
“The show is a reflection of the industry, and golf is thriving right now,” “With the surging popularity of golf, we saw the largest number of exhibitors and largest occupied space since 2009, which is encouraging to see.”
The exhibition included over 1,000 exhibitors spread across 1.1 million square feet, showcasing golf’s continuous development in the $102 billion industry. More than 1,200 VIP buyers from 770 golf courses and mass merchandisers attended, totaling $810 million in purchasing power and roughly $2 billion in retail sales potential. The event has progressed beyond typical golf equipment and gear to include fitness, health, and wellness areas, as well as racquet sports and club facilities. The Clubhouse exhibition space was doubled in size, mirroring the trend in golf facilities toward broader member experiences.
Technology was a major focus, with AI-powered golf simulators, effective ball-flight data, and next-generation golf carts catering to growing personal cart ownership. Golf’s trends are shifting, with a record 200 influencers in attendance and robust clothing growth fueled by Gen Z consumers. The PGA Show’s reinvention is in line with industry trends, stressing experiential marketing and innovation. Looking ahead, organizers intend to continue responding to changing company needs in order to ensure long-term industry success.

"Is The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (THG) the Safest Dividend Stock to Buy Now?",THG ,"We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (NYSE:THG) stands against other safest dividend stocks to buy now.
Today, in this article, we will be looking at the 10 safest dividend stocks you might be interested in adding to your portfolio.
The stock market has become increasingly volatile, constantly causing investors to look for stability. But few instruments offer stability as much as dividend-paying stocks.

With fresh trade tensions arising from unprecedented policy revisions from Washington, price appreciation alone may not be a dependable strategy for investors. Income-focused portfolios are becoming more than just a hedge. They are a necessity.
President Trump made a recent announcement, an update to the new tariff policies, whereby a whopping 145% rate is slapped on Chinese imports while maintaining a 10% baseline for other countries for 90 days. Negotiations are expected between the U.S. and other countries during this period, which, if they do not go well, will bring back the reciprocal tariffs originally announced on April 2, 2025. The announcement sent ripples once again across the global trade. All the major indices are struggling to find equilibrium in the middle of the uncertainty. The situation further raises the importance of stabilized equities that could remain immune to the market whiplash up to some level.
In this regard, safe dividend stocks provide income without compromising their defensiveness – qualities that are becoming harder to ignore in today’s time. Investments in dividend stocks are not just about cushioning against losses but also about long-term compounding and shareholder rewards. Investors prioritize dividends for the sake of sustainable yield that builds wealth gradually. Companies with strong dividend track records have historically stood against worse market conditions more effectively than their non-dividend counterparts. These stocks have safely harbored elevated capital inflow at times of increased volatility, indicating their trust in the broader market.
Recent market turmoil sees value-based investments in dividend-yielding equities becoming a compelling alternative to growth stocks investing among institutional players. Multiple strategists covered by CNBC noted portfolio managers pulling their investments from speculative names and diverting into more fundamentally grounded positions to overcome the unpredictable policy actions and inflation volatility.
But which dividend stocks to pick? Investors are facing not only economic cycles in today’s market environment but also political cycles. Trade, taxation, and regulation are politicized so that the markets are exposed to a profoundly impactful risk that cannot be quantified. It calls for a revisal of a portfolio that includes equities rooted in strong fundamentals and offers high yields.
With this in mind, our article will explore the 10 safest stocks investors could buy now to add resilience to their portfolios. Our curated selection is designed to offer consistent payouts and protect capital from the tremors induced by policies today. You might want to safeguard your capital, generate passive income, or just sleep better at night. Our picks in this article offer you all these in a market that is anything but predictable.
When assembling our list, we followed a few criteria to optimize our picks for the investors. Primarily, we included those stocks with a minimum market cap of $2 billion to ensure the financial soundness of the companies. We also aimed for those stocks that have outperformed the benchmark, so we excluded those below the 52-week market performance of 3%.
Since we want our article to benefit income-seeking investors, we placed a dividend yield limit of a minimum of 2%. Above all, we included only those stocks with a beta of 0.5 or less. A higher beta suggests higher volatility in market events, which increases the potential risks. All the data in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of April 11, 2025. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield. We have also looked into the hedge fund backing the stock to estimate the institutional interests.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

"Meta (META) Launches Llama 4, Challenges Gemini with Scout & Maverick",META ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

As per Straits Research, the US semiconductor manufacturing equipment market size was pegged at US$13.2 billion in 2024. It is expected to grow from US$13.5 billion in 2025 to US$16.5 billion by 2033. This growth is expected to stem from increasing investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the higher demand for advanced semiconductors in critical sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and EVs.
Straits Research highlighted that the resurgence of semiconductor manufacturing in the US is aided by the government initiatives. The federal push is targeted at reducing the dependency on Asian imports as well as strengthening the domestic supply chains.

"Apple Stock Plunged on Tariff News, But It's Proving to Be Unstoppable in Another Lucrative Area",AAPL ,"Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are currently 26% below their peak from December last year (as of April 10), a drop that has been spurred by ongoing tariff announcements. As of this writing, there is a huge 145% tariff that's implemented on goods leaving China for the U.S. If this remains in place, it could harm Apple, because 80% of its production is still based in China, according to estimates from Evercore.
For consumers, the result could be much higher prices. If the increased costs are eaten by Apple, on the other hand, its profitability will definitely take a hit. There remains a lot of uncertainty about how things will play out.
Despite the potential effects, which are commanding all the attention these days, Apple has proven to be successful in another area that highlights growing diversification in the business model. Here's what investors need to know.
In fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28, 2024), Apple generated $391 billion in revenue, of which 75% came from the sale of products. This includes its popular iPhone, Mac, and iPad lineups. 
But the company's services division is an up-and-coming money-maker, growing revenue 13% in the latest fiscal year, much faster than the overall business. It represents the other 25% of Apple's total sales. 
Within services, Apple is making a bigger push into the financial services realm, where it appears to have developed a strong foothold. 
In 2014, the company launched Apple Pay, its digital wallet solution that lets users connect credit and debit cards to use for transactions in-store and online. More than 90% of retailers in the U.S. accept Apple Pay, which has more than 600 million global users and handles trillions of dollars in payment volume. This is undoubtedly becoming a widely used checkout option.
Apple Card was launched in 2019. This is a credit card that gives consumers up to 3% cash back with no fees whatsoever. Apple partnered with Goldman Sachs to handle the program. The credit card portfolio has 12 million customers (data from early 2024) and $20 billion in balances.
It was reported that Visa offered the tech titan a cool $100 million to end its relationship with Mastercard, the current card network for Apple Card. American Express is also in the mix. What's more, issuers like JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, Synchrony Financial, and others are reaching out to Goldman Sachs, offering to take over the $20 billion in balances and to handle the program.
It makes sense why these heavyweights in the financial services industry would be trying so hard to be Apple's partner. Apple generates enormous amounts of revenue, and its customers are generally known to be more affluent than average. Consequently, there is a lot of buying power here, which can lead to revenue opportunities for banks and payment networks. 
Apple might be facing some headaches due to tariffs and how they can affect its device sales. But its payment and credit card offerings continue to shine brightly. Partners are jockeying for position.
This gets to the discussion of whether or not Apple shares are a smart buy right now, especially since they are 26% below their record high. The price-to-earnings ratio is better than it was in December -- it's now at a 30.2 multiple. 
However, I'm not convinced the tech stock can produce a return over the next five years that can outperform the broader market. Not only is the valuation still elevated, Apple's growth prospects aren't that robust. Plus, there is the unfortunate overhang of the tariff situation.
This is a fantastic business. But investors should pass on buying shares. 
Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:

TJX Companies (TJX) is Jim Cramer’s Retail Winner Pick: “You Know What’s the Best? TJX!”,TJX ,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.
“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”

Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said
“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”
Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.
“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’
For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Coming to The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), Cramer commented:
“The best, you know what’s the best? TJX. A ton of retailers will have to order a lot of inventory to be able to get through the holidays, too much inventory, and they’ll then have to offload their unsold merchandise to TJX. There is a reason this stock keeps finding itself on the new all-time high list, other than the fact that I’m next door to one and I go there all the time.”
TJX (NYSE:TJX) is a retailer that sells discounted merchandise. Its product lineup includes apparel for all ages, home furnishings, jewelry, and various other items. On March 31, Cramer said:
“There’s also seems to be a weird belief that somehow the tariffs won’t hurt retail. I mean, that’s how you got very big moves say in TJ, Walmart, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, maybe their stocks simply got too oversold, or the tariffs are now baked in the stocks. We just don’t know. But we do know that these retail stocks were rallying from the get-go this morning. They’ll definitely be hurt by tariffs. Every one of them.”
Overall, TJX ranks 9th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of TJX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As per Straits Research, the US semiconductor manufacturing equipment market size was pegged at US$13.2 billion in 2024. It is expected to grow from US$13.5 billion in 2025 to US$16.5 billion by 2033. This growth is expected to stem from increasing investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the higher demand for advanced semiconductors in critical sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and EVs.
Straits Research highlighted that the resurgence of semiconductor manufacturing in the US is aided by the government initiatives. The federal push is targeted at reducing the dependency on Asian imports as well as strengthening the domestic supply chains. Leading companies continue to establish new fabs in the US, which helps create demand for advanced wafer manufacturing and fabrication equipment. Overall, the increased requirement for high-performance chips in sectors including defense, telecommunications, and automotive further cements the growth of semiconductor equipment.

Is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?,IBM ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

For this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Information Technology index, which tracks the performance of major tech companies. From there, we identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders and picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.

Commonly known as Big Blue, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational tech company. On March 18, the company revealed a new partnership with NVIDIA aimed at enhancing the power and accessibility of AI for businesses. The collaboration involves integrating NVIDIA’s AI Data Platform into IBM’s hybrid cloud infrastructure, enabling companies to better handle their data and scale AI operations more effectively. IBM Consulting will also support this initiative by helping businesses automate workflows with NVIDIA’s AI technologies.
International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s quantum computing segment has seen notable growth in recent years. Since 2017, its IBM Quantum offerings have brought in close to $1 billion in cumulative revenue—highlighting the early success of its strategy, which combines advanced superconducting qubit hardware, hybrid-cloud capabilities, and the open-source Qiskit software toolkit. The company plans to continue developing this area with a roadmap focused on improving error correction and system fidelity in the years ahead.
In terms of financial performance, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) delivered strong cash results in 2024, generating $13.4 billion in operating cash flow and $12.7 billion in free cash flow. During the fourth quarter, it returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.91%, as of April 10. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 29 consecutive years.
Overall, IBM ranks 11th on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

Is The Walt Disney Company (DIS) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,DIS ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.
To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials.

Bears of the stock highlight headwinds that will impact the company’s performance, notably, theatrical films will never return to levels before COVID-19, high production budgets are in the hundreds of millions, volume of content is high, which is met with a shrinking audience.
In the first quarter of 2025, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) announced a revenue of $24.69 billion, beating estimates by $143.28 million, and an EPS of $1.76 compared to estimates of $1.43. Analysts bullish on the stock recognize these factors and continue to support the price of the stock. The company’s brands are synonymous with homes across the globe, not to mention its acquisition of other brands with strong fan followings, such as Lucasfilm in 2012.
Overall, DIS ranks 5th on our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.

"Netflix, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and more stocks to watch this week",NFLX ,"Markets have been on a rollercoaster ever since President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day,” unleashing a blur of tariff impositions, reversals, reimpositions, retaliatory blows, and exemptions.
For the week ending April 11, U.S. indexes swung wildly — but ended up clawing back some of the ground lost earlier. The S&P 500 closed the week up 8.2%, while the Dow flirted with record territory but ended with a more modest 6% gain. The Nasdaq, powered by dip-buying in bruised Big Tech names, finished roughly 12% above its Monday lows.
On Friday, first-quarter bank earnings arrived with a dose of realism: JPMorgan Chase (JPM), BlackRock (BLK), and Morgan Stanley (MS) all posted strong results but struck a cautious tone on the economic outlook. At the same time, consumer sentiment slumped to its lowest level since 2022.
The safe-haven scramble also continued. Gold soared to a record $3,254.90 per ounce on Friday, and the 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 4.57% — its biggest weekly jump in decades. Analysts cited growing unease over policy volatility, while The Wall Street Journal noted mounting hedging activity and foreign investors shifting away from U.S. debt.
Now comes another high-stakes week, with major companies across finance, healthcare, media, and logistics set to report results. Earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS), Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth (UNH), CSX (CSX), and Kinder Morgan (KMI) will offer a fresh read on everything from M&A to supply chains and consumers’ streaming preferences.
Here’s what to watch this week.
Goldman Sachs kicks off the week. Investors will be watching its earnings for updates on deal pipelines, market volatility, and risk appetite.
Tuesday brings a wave of key reports that cut across sectors. Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) will offer fresh perspective on lending conditions, consumer credit health, and trading activity. United Airlines (UAL), meanwhile, is expected to provide a read on travel demand and cost pressures.
The March Import and Export Price Indexes will also drop, offering clues on tariff effects and supply chain inflation.
Abbott Labs (ABT), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Kinder Morgan, and CSX headline. Together, they’ll offer signals on healthcare demand, regional banking pressures, infrastructure activity, and the state of freight and transport networks.
The March retail sales report — due that morning — could move markets with a read on household spending.

Is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) Among the Best Geothermal Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?,BRK-B ,"We recently published a list of  10 Best Geothermal Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against other best geothermal stocks to buy according to hedge funds.
Geothermal stocks are companies that use heat from the earth to generate electricity, heating, and cooling. This comprises companies in geothermal energy production, exploration, and technology development.
The geothermal market is growing rapidly. On April 2, 2025, Dandelion Energy, a prominent private company specializing in home geothermal heating and cooling, announced a partnership with one of the nation’s largest homebuilders to integrate geothermal systems into over 1,500 new homes in Colorado over the following two years. The program’s goal, which is among the biggest residential geothermal deployments in American history, is to standardize geothermal heating and cooling in new construction. When compared to air-source heat pumps, homeowners may anticipate saving almost $30 million over the next 20 years due to lower energy expenditures and better efficiency. According to a recent Department of Energy report, the widespread use of geothermal heat pumps could reduce the need for 24,500 miles of additional grid transmission lines, which is comparable to crossing the United States eight times. Overall, the collaboration highlights a growing trend toward sustainable homebuilding and lower carbon footprints in residential buildings.
Governor of Colorado Jared Polis stated:
“Geothermal energy – the heat beneath our feet – is a clean energy option that will help save Coloradans money and protect our state for future generations. I’m very excited that Dandelion is building on Colorado’s leadership on geothermal by connecting more than 1,500 Colorado homes to low-cost heating and cooling. It’s good for Coloradans, for our air quality, and our economy,”
As we look forward, according to the International Energy Agency’s report, geothermal energy, which now meets less than 1% of worldwide demand, is anticipated to supply up to 15% of global power by 2050, with an anticipated capacity of 800 GW and approximately 6,000 TWh per year. Advancements in drilling technology, comprising hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, might unlock geothermal resources at depths greater than 3 km, hence extending the global potential. In 2023, more than 75% of global geothermal capacity was utilized, greatly outperforming wind (30%) and solar (15%) in terms of capacity factor. Investment in geothermal energy could surpass  $1 trillion by 2035 due to decreased costs and oil and gas sector expertise. Government support may reduce prices by 80% by 2035, putting geothermal on equal ground with solar and wind. There are still major obstacles to overcome, such as the lack of qualified workers, environmental effects, and delays in obtaining permits. The success of geothermal energy depends on governments streamlining procedures, offering incentives, and encouraging research to fulfill the world’s expanding demand for electricity.
As per Deloitte’s report, rapidly maturing Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) capable of providing 24/7 baseload electricity by accessing deep heat reservoirs are benefiting from federal funding and cross-sector investment in technological advances such as new drilling techniques and extreme heat operations, as well as bipartisan support to accelerate projects. Technology companies are collaborating with developers to produce geothermal electricity, as well as with utilities to facilitate EGS deployments by offering a clean transition tariff to cover the costs and risks of implementing a new technology. Meanwhile, a utility inked the largest geothermal power purchase agreement, reaching 320 MW, to meet a public utility commission’s need to obtain carbon-free power 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

"Microsoft (MSFT) Hits $13B AI Revenue Run Rate, Plans $80B Investment",MSFT ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

"Salesforce, Inc. (CRM): A Top 10 Tech Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher",CRM ,"We recently published a list of Top 12 Tech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other top tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.
Under the umbrella of Fisher Asset Management, Billionaire Ken Fisher has maintained a positive stance on technology stocks, particularly those within the “Magnificent Seven.” While emphasizing the strong performance of these large-cap growth companies, Fisher emphasizes that the ongoing bull market extends beyond just these high-profile names. According to him, the 2024 rally has been broader than it is generally perceived, with growth stocks, especially in tech and communication services, consistently outperforming their value and small-cap counterparts.
Ken Fisher’s discussion revealed a notable trend: tech stocks have tended to outperform during market upswings and underperform during downturns. This pattern, evident throughout the statistics of 2024, strengthens the theory that if investors believe in a continuing bull market, technology stocks will likely remain strong performers. Although they may not always lead the market consistently or across every metric, according to historical evidence, their overall performance consistently outshines most other sectors and groupings.
Fisher’s perspective suggested that while technology stocks may not dominate the market indefinitely, their performance still serves as a bellwether for broader market sentiment. He stated that investing in these companies is not about expecting perfection but recognizing that in bullish environments, they tend to deliver higher returns. At the same time, he warned against focusing too narrowly on these names, as the broader growth category spanning across sectors is also poised to benefit from favorable market conditions.
In summary, Fisher Asset Management’s investment approach shows confidence in the long-term prospects of technology stocks. Though Ken Fisher concedes there are no certainties in the market, he points to a clear directional relationship: when the market rises, these stocks tend to rise more; when it falls, they decline more. For Fisher, this reinforces the strategic value of maintaining strong exposure to tech-driven growth stocks in a bullish environment.
We searched through Fisher Asset Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify the top tech stocks that the firm is invested in. From the resultant data, we ranked the technology equities based on his hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Additionally, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company continues to navigate 2025 with a focus on innovation; it recently introduced Agentforce 2dx, a next-generation AI-powered platform designed to enhance both customer service and internal employee workflows. This launch represents Salesforce’s ongoing efforts to evolve its product offerings in response to dynamic enterprise needs and to maintain its position at the forefront of AI-driven enterprise software solutions.
Investor confidence in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) remains resilient, as reflected by a notable increase in hedge fund participation. 162 hedge funds out of 1,009 in Insider Monkey’s database held stakes in the company, with a combined stake of $15 billion by the end of Q4 2024, as opposed to 116 hedge funds at the end of Q3 the same year, signaling growing institutional optimism about the company’s long-term strategic direction.
Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) recently reported its financial results for the quarter ending in January 2024, revealing a mixed performance that fell short of analyst expectations. While the company exceeded earnings per share (EPS) forecasts, reporting $2.78 adjusted EPS versus the expected $2.61, its revenue of $9.99 billion narrowly missed the consensus estimate of $10.04 billion. Nevertheless, this represented a 7.6% year-over-year increase in revenue for the quarter ending January 31.
The company’s net income improved to $1.71 billion, or $1.75 per share, up from $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, in the same quarter the previous year. This gain highlights Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s continued ability to expand profitability even amid softer-than-anticipated revenue performance. However, some of its core business segments underperformed relative to market expectations. For example, its largest revenue segment, Subscription and Support, generated $2.33 billion in service revenue, up about 8% year-over-year but below the $2.37 billion forecast.
Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) reported third-quarter results that exceeded analysts’ expectations, as the integration of AI technology across the customer relationship management software company’s product offerings has driven robust growth in new deals.”
Overall, CRM ranks 8th on our list of top tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of tech companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Where Will Palantir Technologies Stock Be in 10 Years?,PLTR ,"Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) went public in September 2020, and shares of the software platforms and data analytics provider have jumped an impressive 714% since then as of this writing, though it is worth noting that almost all of the stock's gains have arrived in the past couple of years following the launch of its artificial intelligence (AI) software platform in April 2023.
However, Palantir stock has dropped considerably in the past month or so. The stock shot up remarkably when 2025 began, but it has dropped 38% from the 52-week high it hit on Feb. 18. Palantir's recent slide is because of factors outside of the company's control. The broader stock market negativity triggered by the tariff-induced global trade war has led investors to press the panic button.
The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index has dropped more than 20% in 2025 (as of this writing). Fears of an economic slowdown and a potential recession have led investors to book profits in stocks that delivered outstanding gains in the past couple of years, and Palantir is one of them.
However, the software specialist's sharp pullback of late could entice growth-oriented investors into buying the stock, considering the potential upside it could deliver over the next decade. Let's take a closer look at the catalysts that should act as tailwinds for Palantir over the next 10 years.
Palantir's growth trajectory has started improving since the launch of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) a couple of years ago. The company launched AIP for both commercial and government customers with the aim of helping them build and deploy AI applications tailored to their operations. This platform has gained immense traction thanks to the productivity gains that AIP customers have been achieving, leading to outstanding growth in Palantir's customer base, as well as spending by existing customers.
Specifically, Palantir registered a 43% year-over-year increase in its customer count in the fourth quarter of 2024. Even better, it witnessed an increase in the number of customers signing bigger deals with the company. For example, the number of deals worth $1 million or more signed by Palantir last quarter increased by 25% from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the increase in the number of $5 million-plus deals was bigger at 57% on a year-over-year basis.
These numbers make it clear that Palantir is winning big from the rapid adoption of AI software, a market that's expected to grow at an incredible pace over the next decade. Market research provider Roots Analysis expects the AI software market to generate a whopping $5.2 trillion in annual revenue in 2035, suggesting that Palantir is scratching the surface of a massive end-market opportunity that could help it sustain terrific growth levels over the next decade.
It is worth noting that Palantir has been ranked as the top vendor of AI software platforms by multiple third-party market research agencies such as IDC, Forrester, and others. This explains why customers have been flocking to Palantir's AIP, as the platform has been able to deliver cost and efficiency gains. The company reported a solid year-over-year increase of 56% in its total contract value in Q4 2024 to $1.8 billion.
This led to a big jump in Palantir's revenue pipeline. The company posted a 40% year-over-year increase in its remaining deal value (RDV) in Q4 to an impressive $5.4 billion. The metric refers to the total remaining value of contracts that Palantir has to fulfill at the end of a period. The growth in Palantir's RDV was higher than the 36% revenue growth the company clocked during the quarter.
So, Palantir is setting itself up for much stronger growth in the future. The company should benefit from the addition of more customers, as well as the increased spending by existing customers on its offerings. These factors are contributing toward positive unit economics for Palantir, allowing the company to record much faster growth in earnings as compared to revenue.
Unit economics is a measure of a company's profitability, helping us understand how much money it is making from each customer. Given that Palantir has been able to sign expanded deals with existing customers, a trend that could continue in the future thanks to the proliferation of AI, its margin profile could continue improving.
The following chart clearly indicates that Palantir's margins have improved considerably in the past couple of years, and there is still more room for growth on this front.
Palantir's expensive valuation is a key reason why investors have been booking profits in this stock. After all, stocks trading at a premium valuation are at a higher risk during sell-offs since they are deemed riskier when compared to value stocks. The bad news is that Palantir is still trading at 66 times sales and 145 times forward earnings despite pulling back significantly of late.
So, it won't be surprising to see this AI stock pulling back further thanks to the negative sentiment that's affecting global stock markets right now. However, if Palantir stock continues to slide further and becomes available at a much cheaper valuation, it would be worth buying, considering the huge addressable opportunity available in the AI software market over the next 10 years.
What's worth noting is that Palantir has started growing at a faster pace than the rate at which the global AI software market is expected to grow over the next decade. Roots Analysis is forecasting a compound annual growth rate of almost 31% for the generative AI software market through 2035. Palantir's revenue growth of 36% was much faster than that, while the improvement in its RPO was even better.
There is a good chance that Palantir will be able to sustain healthy growth levels over the next decade in light of the productivity gains that AIP is delivering to customers. So, savvy investors would do well to keep an eye on Palantir stock and consider accumulating it if it falls further since it could turn out to be a solid investment over the next decade.

Galbo released their research findings on the consumer staples industry and their expected performance in case of a potential recession. The analysts iterated that in a majority of recent recessions, consumer staples have historically outperformed the S&P 500 as a sector. This trend points towards a defensive edge for the sector. However, the analysts also cautioned that current market conditions, including weak volume growth and lingering high prices, should be considered, as they may affect the sector’s resilience in a future downturn. Despite these concerns, consumer staples make up an appealing sector for investors and experts due to their limited exposure to the recently imposed tariffs, potentially helping sustain valuation multiples.
During recessions, the stock prices in the consumer staples sector are typically affected by earnings per share (EPS) instead of sales growth. Yahoo! Finance reported that sector analysis highlights forward EPS accounting for more than 90% of stock price movement across central subsectors, including Packaged Food, Beverages, Household and Personal Care, and Tobacco. The analysts also opined that these trends reflect the significance of earnings strength when determining stock performance in volatile and uncertain economic conditions.
Yahoo! Finance further reported that the top-performing stocks in the consumer staples sector are likely to share three common traits. These include solid balance sheets with the potential to sustain share buybacks to boost EPS, profit flexibility to offset increasing costs and revenue pressure, and a strong manufacturing presence in the US to constrain tariff-related inflation.
We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 packaged food stocks and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024.

NVIDIA (NVDA) To Spend Billions on US-Made AI Hardware Amid Tariffs,NVDA ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. As US President Trump weighs further tariffs on products coming into the US from trade rivals like China, a Financial Times report has quoted Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, as saying that his firm will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips and other electronics manufactured in the US over the next four years. The announcement follows multibillion-dollar US investment plans announced by other technology companies, including Apple. Huang added that the leading artificial intelligence chipmaker was now able to manufacture its latest systems in the US through suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Foxconn, and that he saw a growing competitive threat from Huawei in China.
Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of these AI companies, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Is Danaher Corporation (DHR) the Best Medical Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,DHR ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.
Some experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country’s entire national output.
Holz said that the country’s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long.

Holz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector.
It is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it’s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven.
In this article, we first sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list of stocks. We then examined Insider Monkey’s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 best medical stocks with the most billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.

It operates through Diagnostics, Biotechnology, Life Sciences, and Environmental and Applied Solutions. Its Biotechnology segment offers a range of equipment and consumables for biological medicines. In contrast, the Life Diagnostics segment offers clinical instruments, devices, consumables, and other services for diagnosing and treating diseases.

This resulted in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of around 135%. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is also active in the M&A domain, completing several strategic acquisitions throughout fiscal 2024 that brought innovative solutions to the company.
Danaher Corporation’s (NYSE:DHR) focus on high-margin bioprocessing in its life sciences sector is central to its growth strategy. The anticipated recovery in bioprocessing is expected to significantly increase the company’s earnings per share (EPS) in the coming years.
On April 7, Citi added Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) to the firm’s Focus List while keeping a Buy rating on the shares with a $265 price target. The firm opined that it sees an attractive opportunity to enter the name as bioprocessing recovery is continually materializing. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is the fourth best medical stock to buy according to billionaires. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund was also bullish on the company, and stated the following regarding Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) released its 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report.

“Really Incredible!” – Jim Cramer Cheers Humana Inc. (HUM)’s Market Moves,HUM ,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.
On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, described the 145% duty on China as so extreme that it essentially acts as an embargo rather than a conventional tariff.
“We now have 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, a number that high frankly isn’t really a tariff. It’s more of an embargo. Almost nobody’s gonna pay that much of a markup. It’s a recipe for losing money.”

Cramer said that he believes Trump is more frustrated with prior administrations for what he sees as allowing China to take advantage of U.S. trade policy than he is with President Xi Jinping himself, who Trump continues to speak of respectfully. While Cramer acknowledged that he sympathizes with Trump’s objective, he warned that the country is not prepared to handle the fallout. “As a nation, shamefully, we’ve gotten addicted to cheap Chinese imports,” he said
“I think what we saw today was the beginning of a sorting period between those that have no China exposure and those that do. Unfortunately, those that do employ a lot of people and are excellent companies, but they may not be excellent enough to make it through this new environment and that is a real shame.”
Cramer emphasized that while he believes the U.S. can function without economic ties to China, doing so would significantly raise domestic costs, drive up unemployment, and force reliance on other global partners. The stakes, he said, are enormous. “Yes, we have to take them on now or never,” he stated, but he cautioned that the consequences will involve more pain than the public is likely prepared to accept.
“So the bottom line: Is it worth it? Depends. I think it’s worth some temporary pain to drive a hard bargain though and get a more favorable trade deal out of the Chinese government. But it’s not worth it to go back… [from] $439 billion in imports to zero. Unfortunately, I’m actually thinking that might be where we’
For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on April 10. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.

Cramer commented on Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) during the episode and said:
“Is the market reflecting any of this? No, but something else is happening too. People are investing in companies, just started yesterday, that don’t have all that much exposure to China or none. You can see it in healthcare, excluding drugs, which are still facing the possibility of their own set of tariffs. UnitedHealth Group and Humana are good examples. They were up once again. I mean it’s really incredible. Former up nearly 3%, The latter up 2%.”
Humana (NYSE:HUM) offers a range of health insurance and care services, including medical plans, pharmacy benefits, and home health solutions. It also provides support for government programs and serves individuals, employer groups, and military members. Year-to-date, HUM stock went up more than 15%. Additionally, in January, Cramer remarked:
“And then the other stocks David that are up, shockingly, are the managed care stocks. Because the Medicare provisions were much better than expected on Friday. Should really help Humana all day.”
Overall, HUM ranks 3rd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of HUM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Sandoz files U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Amgen over arthritis drug,AMGN ,"(Reuters) -Swiss generic drug manufacturer Sandoz said on Monday it had filed an antitrust lawsuit in the United States against Amgen over the alleged entrenchment of the market position of its blockbuster medicine, Enbrel (etanercept).
Sandoz alleges Amgen blocked competition from more cost-effective biosimilar competitors, including Sandoz etanercept biosimilar, Erelzi, by unlawfully purchasing and using certain patent rights to entrench its dominant market position.
Amgen did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Submitted on Friday, Sandoz's lawsuit alleged Amgen has used a ""thicket of patents"" to protect its monopoly for Enbrel through 2029 in violation of U.S. federal antitrust law.
Filed in a Norfolk, Virginia, federal court, it accused Amgen of ""reaping billions in profits while denying purchasers and patients access to the lower prices they would have paid in a competitive market, where Sandoz was able to launch.""
Sandoz in its lawsuit said it ""continues to lose out on millions of dollars in sales each month that it remains sidelined by Amgen's illegal activity.""
In 2024, Enbrel generated $3.3 billion in revenue in the United States, Sandoz said. Etanercept is used to treat a range of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.
Basel-based Sandoz received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for Erelzi in 2016, the same year the company launched the medicine in Europe.
Sandoz wants an injunction to prevent Amgen from using patent rights to block biosimilar competition and allow Sandoz to launch Erelzi as soon as possible. It is also seeking damages.

Asian tech stocks bounce back after Trump tariff exemptions,AAPL ,"TAIPEI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Shares in Asian tech companies that are major suppliers to companies like Apple rose on Monday after the U.S. government granted temporary exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China.
Shares in Foxconn, Apple's largest iPhone assembler, rose as much as 7.8% before trimming gains to close 3% higher. Contract laptop maker Quanta closed up 5.8% and Inventec - which also makes artificial intelligence servers - rose 4.1%.
The broad index closed 0.1% lower
China's Goertek and Lens Tech both rose by more than 7% before also trimming gains. Both firms are Apple suppliers.
Shares in South Korea's Samsung Electronics, which supplies Apple and is also the second-ranked smartphone vendor in the U.S. market, were up 1.5%.
""We view the dizzying weekend tariff news as a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names as it gives some flexibility and allows for China negotiations to hopefully take place in the coming months,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note.
Analysts have warned that U.S. prices of iPhones could surge, given Apple's high reliance on imports from China. Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the U.S. from India, Reuters reported last week.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media on Sunday the electronics products excluded from his reciprocal tariffs ""are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket,"" and would be reviewed along with semiconductors in a national security trade investigation into the sector.
Executives in the electronics sector lamented the Trump administration's regular policy shifts.
Renaud Anjoran, a partner of Agilian, a contract manufacturer of electronics in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub of Dongguan, said keeping up with the changes was ""exhausting"".
""All the customers are basically in panic mode and everybody's busy just following up and reading the news, and contacting and talking to people but no decisions, a lot of things are on hold, that's the situation now,"" he said.
A Taiwanese electronic company executive said the uncertainty was unsettling and it was unclear if the tariff exemptions announced by the U.S. were real or ""just talk"".
The executive declined to be named as he was not permitted to speak to media.
Shares of some chipmakers bucked the trend, after Trump said on Air Force One that he would announce a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, though he added there would be flexibility on some companies in the sector.
Shares in TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, closed 2.7% lower despite having opened higher, while memory chipmaker SK Hynix fell 0.5%.
Alex Huang, vice president of Mega International Investment Services, said the market on Monday morning was reacting to Trump's exemption announcement, but the reaction may be too early as details are still to come out.
""It's impossible that semiconductors will be exempt from the tariffs, as that would eliminate the need for any bargaining chips in talks with the United States,"" he added.
TSMC is due to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday.

"Is Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS) the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?",SWKS ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

For this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Information Technology index, which tracks the performance of major tech companies. From there, we identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders and picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is an American semiconductor company, headquartered in California. The company is playing a key role in advancing the wireless networking revolution. It stands as a prominent developer, manufacturer, and supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products and solutions, serving a wide range of applications.
In the first quarter of 2025, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) reported revenue of $1.07 billion, which fell by over 11% from the same period last year. However, the revenue beat analysts’ estimates by $1.76 million. The company secured 5G content for high-end Android smartphones from brands such as Samsung Galaxy, Xiaomi, and Asus. It also played a role in supporting Gemtek’s introduction of the first AI router, which features a voice-enabled, AI-powered healthcare service.
Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)’s cash position also remained strong. The company generated $377 million in operating cash flow, and its free cash flow came in at $338 million. The operating cash flow represented 35% of its margin, and the free cash flow accounted for 32% of its margin. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share, having raised it by 2.9% in July 2024. This marked its 10th consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes SWKS one of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. The stock has a dividend yield of 5.2%, as of April 10.
Overall, SWKS ranks 13th on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of SWKS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Is McDonald’s Corporation (MCD) the Best Kid-Friendly Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?,MCD ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The market has been undergoing a volatile spell these past few days. Economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a pattern in which stock markets reacted negatively to President Trump’s tariff announcements against China in 2018 and 2019. Current market behaviour in 2025 suggests a similar, potentially more widespread, response to new trade policies. Markets have been underperforming for the first quarter of 2025, considering that the wider market fell by over 10% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ plummeted by more than 15%. The Cboe Volatility Index (aka VIX) is currently at 52.33%, compared to 17.93% at the start of the year.
The year 2025 began with the revelation of DeepSeek, an AI program developed in China, which rivalled AI technology in the US Tech sector. DeepSeek requires lesser processing power, which means lower costs and improved results for users. The market immediately saw investors take on a bullish outlook, short-selling stocks before any further impact on their portfolios.
In the second month of 2025, the US government’s first round of Tariffs was aimed directly at China in an effort to curb the impact of DeepSeek on the United States’ tech industry. In March, President Trump announced a rate of 54% tariff on Chinese goods, while China retaliated with 34% tariffs on US goods and services.
DW (Deutsche Welle) reported that President Trump approved 20% tariffs on European goods & services in the latest round of “Trump Tariffs”. Foreign investors, specifically from European countries, were quick to divest their portfolios. The US economy is considered to be entering “continuous stagflation”, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment.
This scenario has prompted investors to reconsider their future investment strategies. Several reports point out a growing trend among parents who are actively setting aside funds to safeguard their children’s financial future. Survey results of 2000 UK investors over 18 years of age, published by the international adviser, stated that 44% of parents were stressed about making the right investment decisions regarding their children. 35% worry that they have not saved sufficiently to ensure their children’s financial future. In an interview with CNBC, Stacy Francis, the President & CEO of Francis Financials in New York, spoke on how parents can educate their children on investing:
“Make sure that money can be talked about, that there’s no taboos…so that your children are learning those really good financial literacy skills that they need to set themselves up for success for the rest of their life.”
Investing in the markets for your children’s future has the advantage of time. In a report by MorningStar, investments in stocks have the added benefit of compounding return, which means the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. CNBC reported on billionaire investor Mark Cuban and how he made billions from his first few million with a long-term view on his investments.
To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources and gathered the stocks they collectively favored. These stocks have a long-standing history of performance, with strong balance sheets and sound financials. Then, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of billionaire stock holdings to arrive at our list of 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. Billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a global leader in the food service industry. The company operates and franchises McDonald’s restaurants worldwide, offering a diverse menu of food and beverages. McDonald’s utilizes various franchising models, including conventional franchises and developmental licenses, to expand its global reach. It is a household name, especially in the United States, with brands such as McChicken, BigMac, and many more under its umbrella.
McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) experienced a turbulent year-end. The United States food industry was in peril following news of an E. coli outbreak. As a result, negative goodwill towards the aforementioned brands was inevitable. The Q4 2024 earnings report revealed a drop in sales by 28% YoY to $6.93 billion and an EPS of $2.83. Chairman and CEO of MCD, Chris Kempczinski, spoke on the company’s performance during the earnings call, stating:
“First, we have the right strategy, accelerating the Arches. Our MCD growth pillars still offer significant growth opportunities and I’m pleased with the 2025 market plans, particularly their balance of value and full margin food innovation.
McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)’s cash position makes it one of the best kid-friendly stocks on our list. At the end of FY24, the company had approximately $1 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. Due to this cash generation, it has raised its dividends for 48 consecutive years, which is not an easy feat to achieve.
Overall, MCD ranks 8th on our list of best kid-friendly stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of MCD, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MCD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

"Is Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) the Best Medical Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?",MRK ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.
Some experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country’s entire national output.
Holz said that the country’s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long.

Holz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector.
It is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it’s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven.
In this article, we first sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list of stocks. We then examined Insider Monkey’s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 best medical stocks with the most billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a biopharmaceutical company that delivers health solutions to advance the treatment and prevention of diseases in animals and people. Its Pharmaceutical segment offers vaccines and human health pharmaceutical products, which typically consist of therapeutic and preventive agents. Its Animal Health segment develops, discovers, manufactures, and markets a range of vaccines and veterinary pharmaceutical products.
The company is experiencing some headwinds, negatively impacting its revenue outlook. For instance, it has temporarily stopped the shipments of its HPV vaccine Gardasil to China until mid-2025 due to weak discretionary spending. Despite these short-term challenges, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has strong operations, supported by robust demand for its diverse and innovative portfolio. Its Keytruda drug for cancer treatment is performing well, and the launch of Winrevair, a drug that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is also boosting revenue growth for the company.
Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider maintained their bullish stance on the stock, giving it a Buy rating on April 8. The analyst believes that the current market valuation is overly pessimistic, and it appears to be undervaluing Merck & Co., Inc.’s (NYSE:MRK) Animal Health business, which generates significant revenue and is anticipated to grow in the future. This presents a mispricing opportunity for investors, according to the analyst. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ranks eighth on our list of the top medical stocks to buy now.
GreensKeeper Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3%. MRK’s leading HPV vaccine, GARDASIL 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its Chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. Despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for GARDASIL 9 remains promising. Meanwhile, the company’s $27 billion Keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth.”
Overall, MRK ranks 8th on our list of best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Arista (ANET) Lifts 2025 Outlook to $8.2B on Hyperscaler Ethernet Demand,ANET ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) engages in the development, marketing, and sale of data-driven, client to cloud networking solutions for data center, campus, and routing environments. Despite experiencing slower initial traction in AI revenue compared to peers, the firm is expected to benefit from the widespread adoption of Ethernet by Tier 1 hyperscalers and Tier 2 cloud companies this year. The company recently revised its 2025 revenue growth outlook to 17% or $8.2 billion, up from the initial guidance range of 15% to 17%. This optimism reflects strong demand across AI, cloud, and enterprise sectors. For Q1 2025, the revenue guidance is $1.93 billion to $1.97 billion, with a gross margin estimate of approximately 63% and operating margin at 44%. UBS has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $115.

"Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO): One of the Best Technology Dividend Stock to Invest in?",CSCO ,"We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other best technology dividend stocks.
There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013.
In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future.
What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion.
The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies:
“We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.”
Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector.

The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an American multinational digital communications tech company that deals in networking hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by 15%, outperforming the broader market. The company has solidified its leadership in enterprise networking, maintaining a strong presence in both conventional and next-generation network technologies. Cisco continues to dominate key areas such as wireless access, switching, and routing while also playing an integral role in security and collaboration solutions. As businesses increasingly turn to hybrid cloud models and embrace more flexible work arrangements, the company stands to benefit from these shifting dynamics. Its broad portfolio of integrated networking and security tools provides a distinct competitive advantage.
In fiscal Q2 2025, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) delivered better-than-expected results, reporting adjusted earnings of $0.94 per share on revenue of $13.99 billion—exceeding analyst forecasts of $0.91 in EPS and $13.87 billion in revenue. The company’s revenue rose 9.4% year-over-year, with AI infrastructure orders totaling $350 million. Management highlighted a 29% increase in total product orders compared to the previous year, or 11% growth excluding the impact from Splunk.
Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) also reported a robust cash performance, with operating cash flow climbing 177% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, up from $0.8 billion in the same quarter of fiscal year 2024. By the end of the quarter, the company held close to $17 billion in cash and equivalents. On February 12, Cisco announced a 3% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share, marking the 18th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of April 10, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.9%.
Overall, CSCO ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than CSCO but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is an American multinational computer technology company. According to analysts, the company has bright prospects. With the rising demand for AI services, the need for advanced data centers to power these applications has surged as well. Oracle, a major global player in the data center server space, has seen gains from this trend as the market increasingly seeks high-performance, state-of-the-art servers. In addition to supplying these systems, the company also runs an extensive cloud data center network of its own. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 9.5%.
In fiscal Q3 2025, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported a revenue of $14.13 billion, which grew by 6.4% from the same period last year. The company posted cloud revenue—comprising both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)—of $6.2 billion, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase in US dollars. Specifically, revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment (IaaS) rose by 49% to reach $2.7 billion. The company has secured cloud agreements with several leading tech firms, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, and AMD.

On April 8, BofA Securities analysts Bryan D. Spillane, Lisa K. Lewandowski, and Peter T. Galbo released their research findings on the consumer staples industry and their expected performance in case of a potential recession. The analysts iterated that in a majority of recent recessions, consumer staples have historically outperformed the S&P 500 as a sector. This trend points towards a defensive edge for the sector. However, the analysts also cautioned that current market conditions, including weak volume growth and lingering high prices, should be considered, as they may affect the sector’s resilience in a future downturn. Despite these concerns, consumer staples make up an appealing sector for investors and experts due to their limited exposure to the recently imposed tariffs, potentially helping sustain valuation multiples.
During recessions, the stock prices in the consumer staples sector are typically affected by earnings per share (EPS) instead of sales growth. Yahoo! Finance reported that sector analysis highlights forward EPS accounting for more than 90% of stock price movement across central subsectors, including Packaged Food, Beverages, Household and Personal Care, and Tobacco. The analysts also opined that these trends reflect the significance of earnings strength when determining stock performance in volatile and uncertain economic conditions.
Yahoo! Finance further reported that the top-performing stocks in the consumer staples sector are likely to share three common traits. These include solid balance sheets with the potential to sustain share buybacks to boost EPS, profit flexibility to offset increasing costs and revenue pressure, and a strong manufacturing presence in the US to constrain tariff-related inflation.
We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 packaged food stocks and chose the top 10 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database.

Apple (AAPL) Faces 28% EPS Hit Amid Tariff Fears Despite AI Rollout,AAPL ,"We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The buzz around the AI offerings of the firm, including the rollout of Apple Intelligence features to iOS devices across the world, has been overshadowed by the US-China trade war. Apple derives a large portion of revenue from the sales of iPhones, which are assembled in China, and US President Trump has announced a dramatic increase in tariffs on products shipped to the US from China. Investment advisory Needham recently estimated that Apple’s full-year, fiscal 2025 earnings per share estimate is calculated to fall by 28%, or $2 per share, if the iPhone maker isn’t granted an exemption from Trump’s tariff plan. Needham currently estimates a full-year fiscal 2025 EPS estimate of $7.32. If Apple is not granted an exemption, Needham expects it to fall to $5.27.

Why Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is the Best Medical Stock to Buy According to Billionaires,JNJ ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best medical stocks to buy according to billionaires.
Some experts view medical, healthcare, and big pharma stocks as immune from trade carnage, making them a safe haven amid the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s tariffs. On April 8, Mizuho Securities America healthcare sector strategist Jared Holz appeared on CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ to talk about whether the speculations around the healthcare sector being a safe haven during market turmoil are true. He also discussed why healthcare companies are failing to get increased investor respect, given that healthcare is 20% of the American economy, which translates to around 1/5th of the country’s entire national output.
Holz said that the country’s major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies undoubtedly help fight its healthcare problems. However, when we look at their financial models and the way their businesses are currently set up, we have got generic patent cliffs over the next 5-7 years on the medium to long-term angle of the company, along with price concessions with the IRA and some of the things the Biden administration put into place. We have also got pricing degradation over the near term, and between those two lies competition and other setbacks. The models thus never line up well enough for investors to have a lot of confidence, as the business models do not lend themselves to long-term viability. These are the primary reasons the sector and stocks have been under pressure for so long.

Holz further opined that managed care, particularly the government-centric names, are somewhat safe as they are insulated from tariffs as US-based companies. In fact, the economic slowdown is actually beneficial for them as they want less utilization and less patience through the system, which is how they typically beat numbers. He said that managed care is having a good day, and investors might think about owning some companies in the sector.
It is, however, a relative game, as there are several different variables at play, and investors are essentially playing a game of hopscotch in an attempt to jump from one area to another, whether it’s tariffs, drug pricing, or other public policies. He painted a similar picture for medical device stocks that are more US-centric. These two sectors thus have less risk relative to others, making them somewhat of a safe haven.
In this article, we first sifted through ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list of stocks. We then examined Insider Monkey’s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 best medical stocks with the most billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.

"Is Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) the Best Stock for 15 Years?",CRM ,"We recently published a list of Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 15 Best Stocks for 15 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other best stocks for 15 years.
Russell Investments believes that 3 features are defining the market outlook for 2025. These include the elevated level of the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio, the potential for further US dollar strength, as well as the direction of the US 10-year Treasury yield. The active equity managers have been challenged by the severe market concentration. The firm opines that a flattening out of such trends— which can be seen due to policy shifts or change in sentiments related to earnings growth and valuations for mega caps — can support active manager outperformance.
Russell Investments remains focused on sectors in which AI adoption has been ramping up, including industrials, healthcare, and consumer goods. As per the firm, companies that leverage AI for productivity improvements remain well-placed to gain a lasting competitive edge and provide healthy returns. Therefore, skilled active managers are required to look for such companies, primarily those that are in less-covered segments of the market.

With respect to real assets, Russell Investments sees attractive investment opportunities in real estate and infrastructure, mainly sectors that can benefit from the stabilization of long-term interest rates and favorable relative valuations in comparison to other growth assets. The application of AI in real estate, like data centers and healthcare facilities, continues to emerge as a critical growth area. Furthermore, the infrastructure investments continue to gain momentum from energy utilities and pipeline exposures, given the US administration’s emphasis on expanding LNG (liquified natural gas) production.
The firm also believes that an early focus on deregulation and tax cuts would likely be well-received by equity investors. Overall, an expected US soft landing, together with anticipated policy moderation on trade and immigration, creates specific opportunities for well-positioned portfolios, says Russell Investments.

Trump-fuelled debt crisis pushes investors to Britain,BLK ,"The world’s biggest money managers are piling into British bonds as Donald Trump’s trade war sparks a crisis of confidence in the US.
BlackRock, Vanguard and Standard Life owner Phoenix Group, which together manage $20 trillion of funds, bought billions of pounds worth of gilts over the past few days after snubbing US government debt.
BlackRock said British government debt now appeared “attractive” compared to US Treasuries, as Mr Trump’s tariffs put the world’s largest economy’s safe haven status at risk.
Simon Blundell, a fund manager who co-manages a $90bn bond portfolio at BlackRock, said: “We have been buying gilts on the platform this week.
“If we start seeing investors around the globe look to diversify their ‘safe haven’ allocations away from the US to any degree, we feel gilts and other European sovereign markets could be the beneficiary.”
Other large investors are also stepping away from US government debt in favour of European bonds such as German Bunds.
Vanguard, which has more than $10 trillion of assets under management, said it had also increased its holdings of UK debt, including long-dated gilts.
It has done so even as other investors sold off their holdings last week to send yields to their highest level since 1998. This was triggered by turmoil across global debt markets.
At one point, US 30-year yields were on track for their largest weekly rise since 1982, before yields fell back on Friday.
The vote of confidence in gilts from some of the world’s biggest money managers will be welcomed by Rachel Reeves, who could be forced to raise taxes again this Autumn if the trade war tips the global economy into recession.
The UK is paying £100bn a year in debt interest, meaning even small moves in borrowing costs can add billions to the Chancellor’s debt servicing costs.
Ales Koutny, of Vanguard, said its bond traders were adding to holdings in countries with trade deficits with the US, which are set to be more insulated from further tariff shocks.
“We have seen very strong flows towards fixed income, and a meaningful part of that has been into our UK-focused funds,” said Koutny. “As active managers, we believe that there is a right price for everything.”
He added that the US president’s tariff onslaught, including levies of 145pc on imports from China, had inflicted permanent damage on America’s economy.
That is despite a climbdown, when Mr Trump bowed to market pressure by pausing higher tariffs on most countries.
Mr Koutny said: “We do expect some pain to remain, and we do think some damage has been done. Going forward, other metrics are showing the bond markets are now requiring a little bit of extra compensation to deal with the volatility and uncertainty that we have seen.”
America, which has seen its public debt soar to $36 trillion, would be paying the price for years to come, he added, warning that a premium on US borrowing would quickly add up.
“We’re talking about hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars, even for a few basis points here and there,” said Mr Koutny.
By contrast, Vanguard believes the UK offers an opportunity for investors, as Mr Koutny praised the Bank of England’s decision last week to delay an auction of long-term debt.
He added that a move by the Debt Management Office (DMO) to shift away from long-term gilts in the Spring Statement showed policymakers were listening to investors’ needs.
British asset manager Insight, which manages £626.2bn, also said it had been buying “attractive” gilts, while selling off Treasuries “to reduce risk”.
Harry Richards, of Jupiter Asset Management, who co-manages £6bn of multi-sector fixed income investments, said it had cashed in after Mr Trump’s initial tariff blitz by selling some longer-dated US government debt when yields fell and prices rose.
He added that the UK’s weakening growth outlook meant they “continue to see an opportunity here, albeit the path to lower yields is likely to be volatile”.
Phoenix Group, Britain’s biggest long-term savings group, said it had also bought gilts this week.
Mike Eakins, chief investment officer of the FTSE 100 firm, said: “With geopolitical tensions brimming at the minute it is clear this is a new phase for the bond markets”, adding the company was investing in a “prudent manner”.
However, others warned that the Liz Truss mini-budget still loomed large in investors’ minds.
Alex Everett, a fund manager at Aberdeen Investments, said: “I would say that after the mini-Budget stress, investors have been much more shy [sic] about expressing long-term structural views in the UK, and whenever we see a global episode of stress, the UK has been on the forefront of the liquidations.”
He added that he was pivoting his portfolio towards German debt, despite the government’s commitment to spend hundreds of billions of euros on defence and infrastructure.
Mr Everett said: “We’ve been shown very clearly by what Trump has been doing that the role of the US as a safe haven is no longer as clear, and to be frank, that the US is less keen to cement its place in that position.
“And so that means that when the market is fearful, we’ve been turning to Bunds, which despite the supply increase offers a much higher degree of stability.”

As per Straits Research, the US semiconductor manufacturing equipment market size was pegged at US$13.2 billion in 2024. It is expected to grow from US$13.5 billion in 2025 to US$16.5 billion by 2033. This growth is expected to stem from increasing investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the higher demand for advanced semiconductors in critical sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and EVs.
Straits Research highlighted that the resurgence of semiconductor manufacturing in the US is aided by the government initiatives. The federal push is targeted at reducing the dependency on Asian imports as well as strengthening the domestic supply chains. Leading companies continue to establish new fabs in the US, which helps create demand for advanced wafer manufacturing and fabrication equipment. Overall, the increased requirement for high-performance chips in sectors including defense, telecommunications, and automotive further cements the growth of semiconductor equipment.

KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) designs and manufactures yield-management and process-monitoring diagnostic and control systems for the broader semiconductor industry. The company has had its stock upgraded from “Equalweight” to “Overweight” by Morgan Stanley. This was backed by a favourable outlook on the company’s growth potential in the wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) sector. As per the analysis, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is expected to outperform the WFE market.
The firm’s confidence in KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) stems from 2 main drivers. Firstly, Morgan Stanley highlighted the process control intensity as a critical factor, which is expected to witness a structural increase.  Secondly, the firm’s optimism stems from KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)’s potential for market share gains in process control. As per the firm, the company’s position, together with its fundamental technology and data processing capabilities, can allow it to continue to enhance its market share. The company’s continued innovation in process control and yield management solutions places it well to benefit from increasing semiconductor manufacturing complexity, which includes the adoption of EUV layers and the shift to smaller node sizes.
Parnassus Investments, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“We also added several new positions, including two in Information Technology: Workday, a category leader for enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, and KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), a leader in semiconductor process control. KLA, a leader in semiconductor process control, benefits from inherently high switching costs, structurally higher demand for advanced semiconductors and increasingly complex semiconductor manufacturing. The company has a strong management team that is positioning it well for long-term growth. Concerns about weaker demand in China have impacted KLA’s stock price recently, but we believe the secular growth in other regions could offset the risk in the longer term.”
Overall, KLAC ranks 11th on our list of best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than KLAC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.
